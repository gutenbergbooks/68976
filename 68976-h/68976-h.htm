    (printed under the Direction of his Executors) it is presumed, will be highly acceptable to all his Friends, as the just and proper Monument of his Memory and Merit; and both pleasing and useful to the Public in general, but especially to those who desire to cherish and promote the Spirit of primitive Christianity.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    To the Sermons and Tracts formerly published, and which are now ranged in their proper Order, are also added other Pieces, on the most Important Subjects: together with a valuable Collection of Letters, selected and prepared by himself for Publication; in which is displayed, that native Spirit and Simplicity, so eminently conspicuous in his Life and Conversation. His Friends, and even his Enemies (should there be any Such) will here openly behold his unwearied Diligence, undaunted Firmness, noble Disinterestedness, and exceeding Usefulness in the Work of the Ministry; also, his remarkable Fidelity in Friendship, exemplary Piety, and fervent Zeal for the Prosperity of pure and undefiled Religion.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    The Letters and Works can stand in no need of any Recommendation: Connected with the account of his Life, (now drawn from original Papers) they exhibit a plain and undisguised View of the worthy Author, in all Parts of his public Service, as well as in his private Retirements, and inward Trials; faithfully shewing the Whole of that <i>living Temple</i>, which was sacred to <span

    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">H</span>AVING heard the melancholy news of your brother’s death, I could not help sending you a line, to let you know how much I am concerned. Indeed, I cannot say, I am so much grieved on his account, as for that sorrow, which the loss of so valuable a youth must necessarily occasion to all his relations. No! I rather envy him his blessed condition. He, unquestionably is divinely blessed, whilst we are still left behind to wrestle with unruly passions, and by a continued looking unto <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    and running in our christian race, to press forward to that high prize, of which he, <i>dear Youth</i>, is now in full fruition. These are my true sentiments about his death; I leave you to judge then, whether I had need be concerned on his account; and surely was it to be put to your choice, whether so religious a young man should live or die, no one could be so cruel, as to wish to detain him from his wished-for glory. Be not then too much concerned at his death, but let us rather learn that important lesson, which his whole life taught us: “That there is nothing comparable to an early piety.” I thought to have spent many agreeable hours with him in christian and edifying conversation, when I came to <i>Gloucester</i>; but he is gone to more agreeable company, and long before now has joined the heavenly choir.</p>
  <p>
    I shall only add, that as your brother imitated our blessed <span
      class="smcap">Saviour</span>
    in his life, so I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, he may resemble him in
    <a id="p002"></a>his death, and be a means, like his beloved Redeemer, of reconciling all former animosities, which is the hearty wish of, dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="align_rt padr_10 secthdbrk">
    <i>Bristol, <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 10, 1734.</i></p>
  <p class="vm_00">
    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS morning I wrote to you in haste, expecting <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>I.</i>
    would soon be going; but to my great satisfaction, he came hither this night, and soon afterwards, your very much wished-for letter was brought to hand; which (after ten thousand thanks for so many repeated favours) I shall now beg leave to answer. You tell me “<abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P.</i> likes <i>N.</i>” <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be praised! That he hath recommended something to my perusal. I’ll read it, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, with care, at my return. “That he wants to know my quality, state, condition, circumstances, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>”
    Alas! that anyone should enquire after such a wretch as I am. However, since he hath been so kind, pray tell him, that as for my quality, I was a poor, mean drawer; but by the distinguishing grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    am now intended for the ministry. As for my estate, that I am a servitor; and as to my condition and circumstances, I have not of my own any where to lay my head. But my friends, by <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    providence, minister daily to me, and in return for such unmerited, unspeakable blessings, I trust the same good Being will give me grace to dedicate myself without reserve to his service. To “spend and be spent” for the welfare of my fellow-creatures, endeavouring to promote the gospel of his Son as much as lies in my poor power. But “observe his humility,” says <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    Aye, catch an old Christian without profound humility, if you can. Believe me, <i>Sir</i>, it is nothing but this flesh of ours, those cursed seeds of the proud apostate, which lie lurking in us, that make us to think ourselves worthy of the very air we breathe. When our eyes are opened by the influences of divine grace, we then shall begin to think of ourselves as we ought to think, even, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is all, and we are less than nothing. Well, you may cry, O happy temper, could I but learn of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span> to be meek
    <a id="p003"></a>and lowly in heart, I should certainly find rest to my soul. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, for his dear <span
      class="smcap">Son</span>’s
    sake, give it to you, to me, and to all our dear friends! “Some like, some dislike the extract,” you say. I did not do it, to please man, but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. “<abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W.</i>
    is too much engaged in temporals.” Is he? Oh dear Sir, pray that when I enter the ministry, I may be wholly engaged in spirituals: But “<abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    has been ill, and is now recovered.” <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be praised for both! Our Saviour, <i>Sir</i>, learnt obedience by the things which he suffered, so must we. Pain, if patiently endured, and sanctified to us, is a great purifier of our corrupted nature. It will teach us excellent lessons. I hope <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    has been enabled to learn some of them. So much in answer to your kind letter. You say “it was too long.” Believe me, <i>Sir</i>, it was much too short; but a line is more than I deserve. However, I have made out in mine, what was wanting in yours. <i>My Mother’s</i> journey to <i>Gloucester</i>, I fear, is spoiled by the weather. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    blessed will be done! I hope to be with you about next <i>Tuesday</i> sevennight. “I am missed,” you say; and you may well miss such a troublesome guest. Well, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will reward you richly, I trust. Never despair of <i>my brother</i>; when <span

    acts upon the soul, he makes quick work of it. Be pleased to tell <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M.</i>
    that his remissness hath occasioned me many a sigh, and his return from his relapse, matter of abundant thanks to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in his behalf. Oh let us young, unexperienced soldiers, be always upon our guard; the very moment we desert our post, the enemy rushes in; and if he can but divert our eyes from looking heavenward, he will soon so blind us, that we shall not look towards it at all. A great deal may be learned from a little fall. But I must not detain you any longer, than to assure you how much I am, <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Had the favour of your letter last <i>Friday</i>, which brought me the agreeable news of your and <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>’s welfare, together
    <a id="p004"></a>with the much-desired account of your approving the scheme, inclosed in my last. Indeed, I did not doubt of its meeting with a candid reception, from all those persons to whom it was recommended. Their known concern for religion, giving me sufficient assurance, that nothing can be unacceptable to them, which any way tended to promote their improvement in the divine life. It must be confessed, indeed, as you very justly observed, that we must make a great progress in religion, and be inured by frequent prayer and meditation, to the extatic contemplation of heavenly objects, before we can arrive at true heavenly-mindedness; and, perhaps, after all our endeavours, whilst our souls are immersed in these fleshly tabernacles, we shall make but very small advances in so delightful and glorious an undertaking. But believe me, <i>Sir</i>, you cannot imagine, how vastly serviceable the constant use of all the means of religion will be, in acquiring this blessed habit of mind. Such, as an early rising in the morning, public and private prayer, a due temperance in all things, and frequent meditation on the infinite love and purity of that unparalleled pattern of all perfection, our dear Redeemer. As for your mentioning, <i>Sir</i>, the degeneracy of the age, as the least objection against our making further advances in any religious improvement, I cannot by any means admit of it. The scriptures (as I take it) are to be the only rules of action. And the examples of our blessed <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    and his apostles, the grand patterns whereby we are to form the conduct of our lives. It is true, indeed, that instances of an exalted piety are rarely to be met with in the present age, and one would think, if we were to take an estimate of our religion, from the lives of most of its professors, that christianity was nothing but a dead letter. But then it is not our religion, but ourselves that are to be blamed all this while. Would we live as the primitive christians did, we might no doubt have the same assistance vouchsafed us, as they had. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    grace is never restrained, and though we should not arrive at those heights of heavenly-mindedness, as some of the primitive christians were eminent for, yet, methinks we should imitate them as far as we can, and rely on the divine goodness for grants of such a supply of grace, as he, in his good pleasure, shall judge most convenient for us.

The <i>prayers</i>, I hope to send you next week. Only let me give you this caution, not to depend on any advice or book, that is given you; but solely on the grace of <span

    attending it. The book which I have sent to my brother, and would recommend to you and all my <i>Gloucester</i> friends, will soon convince you how dangerous it is to be a lukewarm christian, and that there is nothing to be done without breaking from the world, denying ourselves daily, taking up our cross, and following <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    These things may seem a little terrible at first, but believe me, they are nothing but suggestions of our enemy to deter us from setting out; and if you can credit me, mortification itself, when once practised, is the greatest pleasure in the world. But hold, I shall transgress the time prescribed me, therefore give me only leave to add my hearty prayer for your successful progress in religion, and to subscribe myself in great haste, <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>

    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Believe you think me a strange sort of a person, for not being so good as my word in coming down this winter;
    <a id="p006"></a>and what is worse, in not letting you have a line to acquaint you of my reasons for it. And, indeed, I am not as yet determined; providence having ordered (I hope) that this seeming unkindness shall, in the end, prove very serviceable on all sides. However, though I have been thus hindred, yet, I think you heard from me last, and am really surprized to find you should, now so long since, have desired that <i>collection of prayers</i>, and be wholly unconcerned about them ever after. Indeed, they will be of no service to you, unless you grant me this one postulatum: “That we must renounce ourselves.” What the meaning of this phrase may be, the preface to the prayers will best inform you. I did not doubt of its meeting with but a cold reception, it being (at first view) so very contrary to flesh and blood. For, perhaps, you may think, that this renouncing of ourselves, must necessarily lead us (as it certainly does) to acts of self-denial and mortification; and, that we probably may be saved without them. And lest you should after all imagine, (which I trust you will not) that true religion does consist in any thing, besides an entire renewal of our natures into the image of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    I have sent you a book entitled, <i>The Life of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in the Soul of Man</i>, written by a young, but an eminent christian, which will inform you, what true religion is, and by what means you may attain it. As likewise, how wretchedly most people err in their sentiments about it, who suppose it to be nothing else (as he tells us page <abbr
      title="third">3d</abbr>)
    but a mere model of outward performances; without ever considering, that all our corrupt passions must be subdued, and a complex habit of virtues, such as meekness, lowliness, faith, hope, and the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and of man, be implanted in their room, before we can have the least title to enter into the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Our divine master having expressly told us, that “unless we renounce ourselves, and take up our cross daily, we cannot be his disciples.” And again, “unless we have the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    we are none of his.” You will scarce have time, I imagine, before <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    leaves <i>Gloucester</i>, to revise, what I have recommended to your perusal. However, be pleased to let me hear from you by him, together with an account of your free sentiments about this matter. I trust (by <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    grace) we shall, at last, rightly understand one another’s meaning. I should be glad to hear too, whether you
    <a id="p007"></a>keep morning prayers, and how often you receive the holy communion, there being nothing, which so much be-dwarfs us in religion, and hinders our progress towards the heavenly Canaan, as starving our souls by keeping away from the heavenly banquet. I have nothing more to add at present on this subject, till you favour me with a line, which, I hope, you will not fail doing by <abbr

    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Had the favour of your letter by <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    and, as desired, I have made enquiry about the post-masters and clerks of Merton. As to the former, I hear, that the five senior fellows have each a power to elect one in his turn, and that there is now a vacancy, but one ready on the spot to supply it, and no likelihood of there being another this long while. The latter, are solely in the power of the warden, and though all the places are at present filled up, yet, there will be a vacancy next term, so that, perhaps, by a seasonable application, your brother may get a friend in. Thus much for business. As for the other particular, specified in the latter part of your last; I find by what I can gather from your own and my brother’s expressions, as well as from <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>’s
    discourse, that my late letters have met with but a cold reception; and that you seem desirous of hearing no more of so seemingly ungrateful a subject, as submitting our wills to the will of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    which, indeed, is all that is implied in that phrase (which our enemy would represent as so formidable to us) of <i>renouncing ourselves</i>. Alas, Sir! what is there that appears so monstrously terrible in a doctrine that is, (or at least ought to be) the constant subject of our prayers, whenever we put up that petition of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s:
    “<i>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven.</i>” The import of which seems to be this. <abbr
      title="First">1st</abbr>. That we do every thing that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    wills, and nothing but what he willeth, <abbr
      title="Secondly">2dly</abbr>,
    That we do every thing he wills, <i>only</i> in the manner he willeth. <abbr
      title="Thirdly">3dly</abbr>,
    That we do those things he willeth, only
    <a id="p008"></a><i>because</i> he willeth. This is all, Sir, I have been endeavouring to inculcate in my late letters; and though it seems as clear as the light, upon an impartial and considerate view, yet, our grand impostor (whose very corruption is having a will distinct from, and therefore contrary to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s)
    would fain set it out in the most hideous colours, as though we were “Setters forth of strange doctrines;” or proposing some higher degrees of perfection, than every ordinary christian is obliged to aspire after; whereas, in truth, it is nothing but the simple and evident language of the gospel. It must be confessed, that through the corruption of our depraved nature, and that power, which self-will has, since the Fall, usurped in the soul, we must necessarily break through a great many obstacles. But, dear Sir, be not dismayed, the difficulty lies only in our first setting out. Be but vigorous at the first onset, and never fear a conquest. The renewal of our natures is a work of great importance. It is not to be done in a day. We have not only a new house to build up, but an old one to pull down. But then, methinks, this would be an odd way of reasoning, “Because a thing requires some pains, I therefore will never set about it.” No, Sir, rather up and be doing. Exert your utmost efforts at your first setting out, and take my word, your strength as well as resolution will increase daily. The means also which are necessary to be used in order to attain this end, our
    cursed adversary the devil would represent to us in the most hideous forms imaginable. But believe me, Sir, the difficulty here too, only lies in our first breaking from ourselves, and that there is really more pleasure in these formidable duties of self-denial and mortification, than in the highest indulgences of the greatest epicure upon earth. Give me leave, dear Sir, only to remind you of one particular, which, if duly observed, will vastly facilitate your future endeavours. Let the scriptures, not the world, be your rule of action. By those you are to form your practice here, and to be judged hereafter. Upon this account, for the future, I should be glad, if you would communicate what passes between you and me, to none but my brother and your spouse. And if you have any, the least scruple, be pleased to send me word of it by a letter in an open, friendly manner; and, by <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    blessing, all things will be yet set right; only be fervent
    <a id="p009"></a>in prayer. As for what the <abbr
      title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Hoar</i>
    has been pleased to say, either to you or <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    it is not my business (out of deference, as he is so much my superior, as to the dignity of his office, his age, and his learning) to make any reply. I shall only add, what I am sure I can prove, “That the gospel tells us that there is but one thing needful. That we cannot sit down content with just such a degree of goodness, and claim just such a proportionable degree of glory;” but that “we are to love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> with all our souls, strength, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>”
    and that “he who endureth to the end, (and he only) shall be saved.” There is a little treatise lately come out, which I have made bold to send to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Hoar</i>,
    where we may be fully convinced by argument deducible merely from reason, “that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is our sole end,” and that barely upon a principle of prudence, (supposing we could be happy without it) we ought to press forward, in order to attain the greatest degrees of happiness hereafter. Whether this letter, Sir, may prove as offensive as the former, is not my business to enquire. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    will be done in all things. He, and he alone can (and indeed will, if we are desirous of it ourselves) work this conviction in our minds. Give me leave just to add, that I thought it my duty to answer these few objections, that have been raised against the difficulty of conforming our wills to the will of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    by shewing that the greatest struggle lies only at our first beginning, and that it is no more than what is indispensably necessary for our salvation. As for the means to be employed for the attainment of this end, I shall be wholly silent: Being sensible, that if you are once fully convinced of the greatness of it, you will be necessarily carried on to the use of such means as <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath constituted for that purpose. I hope my writing after this manner, Sir, will not be esteemed a piece of self-conceit, or be an instrument of unloosing our former band of friendship, which was once designed to be bound the faster, by tying it with a religious knot. But whether this proves to be the event, or not, of my telling my friends the truth, I wholly leave to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    Providence. Be pleased however to favour me with a line in return, and give me leave to subscribe myself, Dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">L</span>AST night about eight o’clock, your good spouse and myself came safe to our journey’s end, and met with a very kind reception from all parties. After you left us, the ladies grew more serious, and at last by the assistance of <i><abbr

    our discourse ran into a proper channel. My brother does not propose sailing this fortnight; but tho’ he stays longer than he proposed, yet I hope to be at <i>Gloucester</i> on Wednesday, for methinks my heart is still there, tho’ my body be at thirty miles distance. On whose account, I leave you to guess. I cannot help reflecting on Sunday. Did not those sighs, think you, Sir, proceed from some unusual meditations on the importance of religion? Were they not some infant strugglings after the new birth? Surely they were. And I trust ere long, after a few strugglings with corrupted nature, the Holy Ghost will replenish your heart with comfort and peace. Proper retirement and solitude are no bars; but rather great helps to a religious life. We find, our Saviour was led into a wilderness, before he entered on his publick ministry, and so must we too, if we ever intend to tread in his steps. As for my brother, I trust the cares of the world, the desire of riches, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    will not always choak the good seed. However, I hope you my dear friend will not defer so important a thing. But, why do I say hope, when I am assured you will not. Methinks, I would willingly undergo the pangs, so you might enjoy the pleasures of the new birth. But this must not be.

    and to beg others to join with me in that important, that delightful duty. You will not forget retaining your old custom of reading and singing. It’s bad to leave off a good custom, and the best way to make a progress in religion, is to persist in, and to improve on the means we enjoy. I suppose honest James by this time is with you. My hearty love to him, and tell him, it would do his heart good to see what a number of true altogether christians here are of his rank. I hope he will let none of them outstrip him: He must watch and pray against self-indulgence, sloth, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    especially if he goes to a place where plenty of all things abound. My
    <a id="p013"></a>due respects and hearty thanks to <i><abbr

    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT a comfort is it for christian friends to relate to each other the loving-kindness of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    O let his praises be ever in our mouths, that we may be telling of his salvation from day to day. O <i>dear Sir</i>, I heartily join with you in the delightful duty of thanksgiving. I hope that you will have every day more and more experimental proofs of that intercourse which is carried on between <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in heaven, and saints on earth.</p>
  <p>
    I must now inform you, that the person, who under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has given me the annuity, is <i>Sir John Philips</i> of London. The occasion of it was as follows. Upon my coming up, two or three of our trusty friends were called from us, and being solicitous to keep up our society here, the gentleman to whom you sent the book, wrote to <i>Sir John Philips</i> and proposed me (alas! how unfit) as a proper person to stay here and encourage our friends in fighting the good fight of faith. Accordingly he immediately offered me an annuity of twenty pounds. To shew his disinterestedness, he has promised me <i>that</i>, whether I continue here or not; and if I resolve to stay at <abbr
      title="Oxford"><i>Oxon</i></abbr>,
    he’ll give me thirty pounds a year. If that will not do, I may have more; so that you see, my dear friend, what a critical point it is. All that we have to do is to pray, and watch Providence between this and <i>June</i>, when I propose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to enter into orders, and then no doubt my call will be clear. What makes me to think that this is a call from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is, that it will be convenient for taking my degree, and improving me in my studies. Whether it be or no, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows; Father, therefore into thy hands I commend my spirit, for thou hast redeemed me, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> thou <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of truth. I approve greatly of your reading <span
      class="smcap">Henry</span>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    works by him here greatly, and may the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    prosper it in your hands. Good dear Sir,
    <a id="p014"></a>never leave off watching, reading, praying, striving, till you experimentally find <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>
    formed within you. In a particular manner, my dear friend, watch against all temptations to sloth. When you receive the sacrament, earnestly endeavour to be inwardly bettered by it the week following. Live every day as holily as you can. Be frequent in self-examination morning and evening. Pray earnestly from your heart. Wrestle with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    beg him to hasten the new birth. Moreover be careful, diligent in your calling, labour hard with your own hands, that you may have to give to him that needeth. And labour not so much for the meat that perisheth, as to neglect pursuing that which endureth to eternal life. O <i><abbr

    <span class="dropcap">N</span>OW tell me the truth, have not you called me ungrateful? If you have not, it is more than I deserve. I have nothing to plead but business, as an excuse for not answering your last kind letter. Well, forgive me this once, and if I offend so again, then call me ungrateful indeed. You order’d me to make no acknowledgments for kindnesses received. You’ll suffer me to ask another favour, if not to return any more thanks. Be so kind then, dear Sir, to desire your brother to write to me as soon as possible. My good friend, <i>Sir John Philips</i>, has promised me thirty pounds a year, if I’ll continue at Oxford, and yet I am in doubt, whether that annuity, and the being appointed to serve the prison here, will be a sufficient title for orders, therefore I beg both his advice and prayers. This is all I think that concerns outward affairs. But this solemn season naturally leads me to say a word or two on a more important subject, “the death and passion of our blessed Lord and Saviour.” If I mistake not, you commemorate it to-morrow at <i>Crypt</i>. And blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I do at Christ Church. And oh that we may commemorate it as we ought;
    <a id="p015"></a>that we may fix our thoughts intensely on that great examplar and all atoning blood; that we may grow in love with his meekness and patience, and endeavour daily to be conformed to his most blessed image. Surely we cannot grow angry at trifles, when the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    endured such bitter usage, without the least murmur or complaint. Surely, we cannot repine at any dispensations of Providence tho’ ever so severe, when we consider, how it pleased <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to bruise our Saviour and lay upon him the iniquities of us all. Whatever befalls us, is but the due reward of our crimes; but this Redeemer had done nothing amiss: he was bruised for our iniquities. I could run through every part of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    sufferings, and shew how <a
      id="p015a" href="#tn_1">♦</a>necessary
    it is that we should sympathize with him in every particular. But as it now grows late, and I want a little time to prepare for to-morrow’s solemnity, you’ll excuse me if I now only paraphrase a little on the prayer of the thief on the cross. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> remember us and pray for us; <span

    kept composed both before and after imposition of hands. I endeavoured to behave with unaffected devotion; but not suitable enough to the greatness of the office I was to undertake.

    <span class="dropcap">N</span>EVER a poor creature set up with so small a stock. When the good Bishop, who ordained me on Sunday, gave out last year in his visitation charge, that he would ordain none under full three and twenty, my heart leap’d for joy, for then I thought my friends would not only be disappointed in their hope of having me enter into orders so soon; but that I should also have time (as was my intention) to make at least a hundred sermons, with which to begin my ministry; but this is so far from being the case, that I have not a single one by me, except that which I made for a small christian society, and which I sent to a neighbouring clergyman, to convince him how unfit I was to take upon me the important work of preaching. He kept it for a fortnight, and then sent it back with a guinea for the loan of it; telling me he had divided it into two, and had preached it morning and evening to his congregation. With this sermon I intend to begin, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, next Sunday, not doubting, but that he, who increased a little lad’s loaves and fishes for the feeding of a great multitude, will from time to time, in the proper use of appointed means, supply me with spiritual
    <a id="p017"></a>food for whatever congregation he in his all-wise Providence shall be pleased to call me to. Help, help me, my dear friend, with your warmest addresses to the throne of grace, that I may not only find mercy, but grace to help in time of need. At present this is the language of my heart,</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, on <i>Monday</i> night. But first let me return dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    my heartiest thanks for all past kindnesses, and assure her, that my incessant prayers shall never be wanting, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may not forget her labour of love, in that she has so plentifully administered to me his unworthy servant, and yet does minister. To-morrow I am to preach at <i>Crypt</i>, but believe I shall displease some, being determined to speak against their assemblies. But I must tell them the truth, or otherwise I shall not be a faithful minister of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Had providence so ordered, I should have been glad to have given you the cup of blessing; but since that favour is denied to me, I am resigned. However, I hope I shall not be unmindful of you, when I come near your place, nor be wanting in my prayers, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    would mercifully supply the want of outward means to you, by the operation of his Holy Spirit. I suppose you are, by this time, pretty well reconciled to <i>Worcester</i>, and that providence has shewn you that we may serve <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    acceptably in any place. Yes, Madam, let but our hearts be upright towards him, and by faith united to our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    we shall find that wherever we are, he will be with us, and we shall be with him. So far I had written on <i>Saturday</i> night; but being detained here in expectation of seeing my brother <i>James</i>, (who has not as yet been
    <a id="p018"></a>so good as his word) I believe I can now acquaint you that I must set out on <i>Wednesday</i> morning. I preached yesterday at <i>Crypt</i>, and was mercifully supported and assisted, for which great blessing, I hope you will return hearty thanks in my behalf. I trust Miss <i>James</i> continues her former earnest desires to be renewed in the spirit of her mind; for nothing will do but that. Indeed we may flatter ourselves, that we may go to heaven without undergoing the pangs of the new birth; but we shall certainly find ourselves desperately mistaken in the end. For till we are changed, till we are made meet for, we cannot in the nature of the thing be partakers of the heavenly inheritance with the saints in light. Let us therefore never cease praying and striving, till we find this blessed change wrought in us, and thereby we ourselves brought off from relying on any or all outward ordinances for salvation. Our good bishop <i>Benson</i> was pleased to give me another present of five guineas, a great supply for one who has not a guinea in the world. May the great Bishop of souls amply reward both him and you, for all favours conferred on</p>

    <i>Mary De Crypt</i>, where I was baptized, and also first received the sacrament of the <span

The sight at first a little awed me; but I was comforted with a heart-felt sense of the divine presence, and soon found the unspeakable advantage of having been accustomed to public speaking when a boy at school, and of exhorting and teaching the prisoners and poor people at their private houses, whilst at the university. By these means I was kept from being daunted over much. As I proceeded, I perceived the fire kindled, till at last, though so young, and amidst a croud of those, who knew me in my
    <a id="p019"></a>infant childish days, I trust, I was enabled to speak with some degree of gospel authority. Some few mocked, but most for the present seemed struck; and I have since heard, that a complaint had been made to the bishop, that I drove fifteen mad the first sermon. The worthy prelate, as I am informed, wished that the madness might not be forgotten before next <i>Sunday</i>. Before then, I hope, my sermon upon <i>He that is in <span

      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>Well</i>’s letter, as a sufficient excuse for it, nothing but those, I assure you, being the cause of it. Well then, presuming on your kind pardon, give me leave, (after all acknowledgments of gratitude for kindnesses received) to bid you once more welcome to <i>Gloucester</i>, and to wish you and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    with all my soul, the greatest comfort, that either this or the other world can afford you. It’s true, indeed, we must not expect much comfort here, except what results from a good conviction that we are in a safe state, by being born again of the Holy Ghost. This, will afford us inexpressible satisfaction, even on this side the grave. It will give us ease in pain, because we know, if we bear it patiently, it will end in glory. This, will make us meek and gentle under crosses and disappointments, because we know we are taught to expect them, and that our blessed Master has gone before us in them. In short, it will make us easy in every station, because we have a general promise, that all things shall work for good to them that love <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    But supposing we were to have no pleasure on this side of Heaven, yet the
    <a id="p020"></a>thoughts of being happy, and that too for all eternity hereafter, methinks should teach us to bear up under every calamity here, not only with submission, but a holy joy. Good <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    the very idea of what we are to be in glory, transports me while I am writing. There, there, <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    we shall see the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    whom our souls have so eagerly thirsted after in this life, surrounded with glory, and attended with myriads of his holy angels, who will rejoice at our safe arrival to their happy mansions, and with repeated echoes welcome us to heaven. There, there, we shall not only see, but live with him and enjoy him too, not for a day, a month, a year, an age, but to all eternity. And who can tell the pleasure, comfort, peace, joy, delight, and transport, a glorified saint will feel in the possession of his wished-for, longed-for, ever adorable, ever gracious, blessed, beloved, triune <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and that for ever? Surely the happiness will be so great, that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither can the heart of man conceive the thousandth part thereof. And yet, great as it is, I not only wish, but have good hope through <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    that not only you and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    but all my christian friends, and even I myself through grace, shall one day be partakers of it. The way and means we know. “If any one, says <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    will come after me (to glory) let him renounce himself.” <abbr
      title="that is"><i>i. e.</i></abbr>
    make his own will no principle of action, be no self-pleaser, “and take up his cross” patiently (whether of sickness or outward circumstances, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>)
    “and then let him follow me,” follow me in a way of duty here, and he shall follow me to glory hereafter. May we all be such followers of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>!
    And why should we despair of becoming such? What is there in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    doctrine or example but that we may all, through the assistance of the Holy Spirit, imitate him in? Suppose it does oblige us to be a little stricter than our neighbours? Suppose it does forbid us spending too much time in the seemingly-innocent entertainments of the age? Suppose it does command us to be constant and frequent in prayer, in watchings, fastings, and other acts of mortification? Suppose it does bid us not to indulge our unruly passions; but to learn of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    to be meek, patient, and lowly? Suppose it does compel us to redeem our time, to fill up every day with proper duty and devotion? Yet, what in all this, that is terrible? Has not such a behaviour
    <a id="p021"></a>a natural tendency to make us calm, easy, peaceful, happy? And then, why should we refuse so easy a yoke, so light a burden? I am sure the little (alas! too, too little) time I have drawn in it, I have found it not galling but healing, and the longer I bear it, the easier and pleasanter it is. Let us then, Dear <abbr

    to receive every thing with an equal, undisturbed mind, perhaps the contents of it might have given me some small uneasiness. But religion quite changes the nature of man, and makes us to receive all the dispensations of providence with resignation and thankfulness. Of this, dearest Sir, I hope you have had an experimental proof, in bearing up with courage and resolution under those acute pains the Almighty was pleased to visit you with last <i>Sunday</i>, and with which, perhaps, his infinite wisdom and goodness may continue to visit you longer. My dear friend (if I mistake not) used to say, he was afraid <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    did not love him, because he did not chasten him. Behold then, now the hand of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is upon you, not so much to punish, as to purify your soul. Not in anger but in love. Pray therefore in your easy intervals, that you may know, wherefore the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    contendeth with you, and that you may not come cankered out of the furnace of affliction. Offer up every groan, every sigh, in the name of your dying, risen Redeemer, and doubt not, but they will be as prevalent as set times of prayer. Our being enabled to pray when sickness comes on us, doubtless, is to teach us the necessity of praying always, when we are in health. But, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    wants no such lessons, or excitements, I
    <a id="p022"></a>believe, to prayer. Methinks I could bear some of your pain for you, if that would give you comfort. But as it is impossible, O let me never cease most earnestly to beseech my heavenly Father, that he would sanctify this his fatherly correction to you, and that the sense of your weakness may add strength to your faith, and seriousness to your repentance. Poor <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Pauncefoot</i>, I find, is visited in a far more grievous manner. Dear good man, surely the time of his dissolution (I should say of his coronation) draweth near. See, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    through what tribulations we must enter into glory. Be pleased to give my hearty love and thanks to him for his last kind letter. Beg him not to cease praying for me, unworthy as I am. And, I hope, I shall not be wanting in returning his kindness in the same manner. But alas, I have nothing to depend on, but the merits of a crucified Redeemer to have my poor petitions answered. But does dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    complain of deadness and coldness in devotion? Alas poor woman! let her not be disheartened. This is a complaint, which all the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    have made. And we must take a great deal of pains with our hearts, must pray often and long, before we shall be able to pray well. And the only way I can think of, to shame ourselves out of deadness in prayer, is to censure and condemn, to humble and bewail ourselves for it every time we go upon our knees, at least every time we solemnly retire to converse with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. But why does dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    so much as think of omitting but once the receiving of the holy sacrament? Or if satan does put such thoughts in her head, why does not she repel them with the utmost abhorrence? Alas! should the devil gain his point here, would not the ridiculing world say, <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    began to build, but had not wherewith to finish. I have seen too many fatal instances of the inexpressible danger and sad consequences of leaving off any one means of grace, not to encourage <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    stedfastly to persevere in the good way she has begun; and would exhort her, in the name of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    to labour daily to mortify and subdue her corruptions, not wilfully to indulge herself in any ill habit, custom, or temper, and then assure herself, one time or another, <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    will be made known unto her in breaking of bread. But what shall I say, dear Sir, about <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <a id="p023"></a><i>W.</i> <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr> <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>?
    Alas! I find, they are all in the gall of bitterness, in the very bondage of iniquity, and all I can do, is to pity and pray for them. I find more and more, that where true religion is wanting, there is confusion and every evil work. But why is my honoured mother so solicitous about a few paultry things, that will quickly perish? Why will she not come and see her youngest son, who will endeavour to be a <i>Joseph</i> to her, before she dies? What makes my dear friend and his kind wife, give me another invitation to <i>Gloucester</i>? Alas! have I not wearied and been expensive enough to you already? I hope to send you, in a short time, two guineas towards paying for <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Henry</i>’s Exposition. I wish I could spare more, but time will bring all things to pass. You see what a large letter I have written to you to make amends for the many short ones, I have sent lately. Though I believe you may say of mine, the quite contrary to what I say of yours; the shorter the better. My due respects to all friends, and believe me to be, in the utmost sincerity, Dearest Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span>F you remember, I promised you a long and particular letter when I was at <i>Gloucester</i>, and nothing hinders but I may now perform it. Permit me then first, to begin this, as I would all my letters, with thanks to you and kind <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    for your inexpressible favours conferred on the most unworthy of my master’s servants; and, withall, to assure you, how incessantly I pray, that the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of all grace and mercy, for the sake of his dear Son <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    would reward you in spirituals, for what you have done to me in temporals, and feed your soul with his heavenly graces, as plentifully as you have fed my body with nourishing food. But as, in all probability, this will be the last letter I shall write to dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    before I sail, what can I fill the remainder with better, than by exhorting you, to lay aside every weight, particularly the sin that does most easily beset you, and so run with patience the race set before you. I say, the sin that most easily besets; for unless we lay the ax to the root, unless we sincerely resolve in the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    to subdue our favourite, our darling passion, and spare not one <i>Agag</i>, though ever so engaging, ever so beautiful, all our other sacrifices will avail us nothing. Suppose therefore, for instance, <span
      class="smcap">Passion</span>
    be our greatest foible. A sincere person will never cease night or day, till he is made meek and lowly in heart. But if it be asked, how he shall do this? I answer, <i>first</i>, let him consider how odious it is in the sight of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and how contrary to the lamb-like meekness of the holy <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    <i>Secondly</i>, Let him reflect how troublesome it must be to others, (for alas what unnecessary disorders, what needless troubles doth the passionate person occasion to all that are round about
    <a id="p028"></a>him?) <i>Thirdly</i>, Let him consider how exceeding hurtful and unpleasant it is to himself; how it ruffles and discomposes his mind; unfits him for every holy duty, and in short makes him a torment to himself and a burden to others. Well, after he has thus seen the deformity of his darling passion, the next enquiry must be, how to get the mastery over it. The first and grand thing, is to get a true and lively faith in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    seeking for it by earnest prayer. To this, we must have recourse in all our struggles; for it’s <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    alone, who can subdue and govern the unruly wills of sinful men, and it is his grace which alone can enable us to mortify our corrupt passions. But then we must take care not to rest in general petitions for conquering this or that corruption; but must descend to particulars. For instance, supposing I am angry with a servant or husband without a cause; What must I do? Why, take the very first opportunity of retiring from the world, and after having bewailed my being angry, earnestly beseech the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all power and might to enable me to withstand such and such a provocation for the future, and notwithstanding I should fail again and again in the very same instance, yet I would again and again renew my petitions to the throne of grace, and never cease praying and striving, till instead of a blind, perverse, troublesome passion, I had the lovely, calm, and delightful grace of meekness and humility planted in its room. Now would dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    take some such method as this (for I suppose by this time, she guesses to whom all this points) I dare say, she would quickly find as much difference in herself as there is between a wise man and an idiot.—And that she may both begin and succeed in this method, is the earnest prayer of, Dear <abbr

      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows that I and some other friends intercede most fervently for you, and very frequently even at midnight. May <span

    sake, hear and answer them! We sail not for <i>Georgia</i> this month. I suppose you have heard of my <i>mighty deeds</i>, falsely so called, by reading the news-papers; for I find some back-friend has published abroad my preaching four times in a day; but I beseech <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <i>Raikes</i>, the printer, never to put me into his news upon any such account again, for it is quite contrary to my inclinations and positive orders. <span
      class="smcap">God</span> still
    <a id="p030"></a>works here. The collections for the charity schools, in all the churches where I preach, are very large. All <i>London</i> is alarmed. Many youths here sincerely love our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>;
    and thousands, I hope, are quickened, strengthened, and confirmed by the word preached. I was never in better health, and never composed more freely. O praise the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    dear Sir, and pray that I may not be self-sufficient but humble. I am glad dear <abbr

    reward her for all her works and labours of love. Blessed be <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows, how earnestly I have recommended you and your’s to his never-failing mercy. On <i>Wednesday</i> night eighteen of us continued all night in praises, and praying for you and our other friends. I know, that passion is the sin, which most easily besets you, and therefore I always pray that you may have grace given you to conquer it, and to learn of <span

    to be meek and lowly in heart. Then, and not till then, you will find rest to your soul. Pardon me, <i>dear <abbr

    for being thus free. Your kindness compels me to it. Had I not a sincere regard for you, I should not express myself thus. Besides, it’s the last time, perhaps, I shall write to you in this world, and therefore would have this letter contain some instructive hints. We sail, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, next week. Great things have been done for us here. Perhaps upwards of a thousand pounds have been collected for the poor, and the charity schools, and I have preached above an hundred times, since I have been here. A visible alteration is made also in hundreds. Last <i>Sunday</i> at six in the morning, when I gave my farewell, the whole church was drowned in tears: they wept and cried aloud, as a mother
    <a id="p032"></a>weepeth for her first born. Since that, there is no end of persons coming and weeping, telling me what <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has done for their souls: others again beg little books, and desire me to write their names in them. The time would fail me, was I to relate how many have been awakened, and how many pray for me. The great day will discover all. In the mean while, I beseech you <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    by the mercies of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> to pray, that the goodness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may make me humble. As yet the divine strength has been magnified in my weakness. Many have opposed, but in vain. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    power conquers all. I am now going as <i>Abraham</i> did, not knowing whither I go; but I commit myself to the guidance of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    good providence and spirit. He that has and doth, will deliver me out of all my troubles. I only wish, I could debase myself low enough, that I might be more fitted for the high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity, to work by. I am a proud, imperious, sinful worm; but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I hope, in time, will conform me to the image of his dear Son. He has begun (for ever adored be his free grace), and I trust, he will finish his good work in me. Out of the money that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has sent me, I will pay all the debts I can. I have sent some of it to <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>Wells</i>, with particular orders how to be disposed of; two guineas are for <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr>
    <i>Farmer</i> towards the debt due to her from my mother. My farewell sermon will be published shortly, with two or three more. Dear <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">H</span>ITHER the good providence of <span

    has safely brought us; our ship cast anchor near this town, and my dear fellow-traveller and I came on shore (to our great comfort) to buy some things we wanted. We have been most courteously treated by the curate of the place, and had some christian conversation. The winds and storms are blustering
    <a id="p033"></a>about our ears, and teaching us lessons of obedience to him, whom winds and storms obey. <span

    Who would but follow the Lamb wheresoever he shall be pleased to lead? Pray, <i>dear Sir</i>, that I may always do so, and then, I am sure, <span

    will never leave or forsake me. You see, dear Sir, I have answered your kind letter much sooner than expectation, in order to express how sincerely I value your friendship, though you differ from me in some outward modes. Indeed, Sir, I hope the favours I have received from you and others of your christian brethren, will never go out of my mind; but I shall often plead them (as I have done already) at the throne of grace. I would willingly be of so catholic a spirit, as to love the image of my divine master, wherever I see it: I am far from thinking <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    grace is confined to any set of men whatsoever: no, I know the partition-wall is now broken down, and that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    came to redeem people out of all nations and languages and tongues; and therefore his benefits are not to be confined to this or that particular set of professors. I only wish, that I may have grace given me to preach the truth, as it is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>;
    and then, come what will, I hope I shall (as I do, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>) rejoice.</p>
  <p>
    You know, Sir, what a design I am going upon, and what a stripling I am for so great a work; but I stand forth as <i>David</i> against <i>Goliah</i> in the name of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> of <span
      class="smcap">Hosts</span>,
    and I doubt not, but he that has and doth, will still deliver unto the end. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give me a deep humility, a well-guided zeal, a burning love, and a single eye, and then let men or devils do their worst.—Dear Sir, I could write more, but nature calls for rest.

For as you have been so liberal in your presents, it would be unpardonable in me, was I niggardly in my letters. No, my dear friend, I hope I never shall cease praying for you and yours, so long as I live. Hitherto I have not. I was praying for you just as I received yours: I am glad to hear you prayed before you wrote to me. Surely <span

Strive then; let us, my dear friend, strive as persons striving for eternity. Let us abstain from all appearance of evil, and avoid all company, that doth not directly tend to the promoting our spiritual welfare. Whether one of the societies you frequent, my dear friend, has a tendency that way, I leave you to judge. I think I have heard you say, it keeps you from family and secret prayer. If that is not a sufficient reason for absenting from it, I’ll say no more. I believe you to be sincere, and therefore, if you consult <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    by prayer and reading his word, your way will be made clear before you. I only add, that I could wish, instead of frequenting <i>that</i>, you would set up another society of a quite contrary nature on the same night of the week. I know <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Should think myself unworthy of your friendship, did I not send you a line now <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has brought me in safety hither. I know you will give thanks, and therefore, <span
      class="smcap">God</span> forbid I should sin against the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    in not informing you of it.—Your prayers have already been heard; for <span
      class="smcap">God</span> (ever adored be his free grace in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>)
    hath been with us of a truth. He hath led us through the sea, as through a wilderness, and brought us to a haven, where I am honoured with many honours.—Any one that knows <i>Gibraltar</i> would be apt to say, Can any good come out from thence? Yes, I assure you, there may; for there are some that are not ashamed of the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    About six o’clock this morning I went to the church, where was assembled a number of decent soldiers praying and singing psalms to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span> as <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    They meet constantly three times a day, and I intend, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, henceforward to meet them. For my delight is in the saints who are in the earth, and those that excel in virtue. I have talked with some of them, and, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    can find the marks of the new birth in them. They pray without ceasing, have overcome the world, hate sin, as sin, love their enemies and one another. They glory in the cross of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and rejoice that they are accounted worthy to suffer shame for the sake of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    O, who would but travel to see how the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is moving on the faces of poor sinners souls up and down the world! <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, I find, has a people every where; <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    has a flock, though but a little flock, in all places.—<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be praised, that we are of this flock, and that it will be our Father’s good pleasure to give us the kingdom!—<i>Gibraltar</i> is blessed with a governor, who hath not absented himself from public worship, unless when he was sick, for these seven years, and yet is very moderate towards the dissenters. Both conformists and nonconformists perform public worship, though at different times of the day, in the same place: They also have a religious society. The good <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    prosper this work of their hands upon them. Whenever we go away, may we leave a blessing behind us. He is a prayer-hearing <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.—Yesterday
    <a id="p039"></a>a major of one of the regiments, unknown to me, took two handsome rooms, and sent for me from on board, desiring me to lodge in them; and I find the people of the house fear <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.—“When
    I sent you without scrip or shoe, lacked you any thing?” said our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    They said nothing.—O, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――,
    I beseech you abound in thanksgiving, and pray that all these blessings may humble my proud heart, and make me willing to follow the Lamb whithersoever he shall lead me. Assure yourself, that you and all your christian friends are constantly prayed for by, dear Sir,</p>

    <i>Gibraltar, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 27, 1738.</i></p>
  <p class="vm_00">
    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">E</span>VER since I left <i>Gravesend</i>, I remember the fulness of your heart. I have been a constant petitioner at the throne of grace for you, and intended writing to you before, but was <a
      id="p039a" href="#tn_5">♦</a>let hitherto. However, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has now brought me safe to <i>Gibraltar</i>, and as I have time, I should think myself inexcusable, did I not send a line to dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――,
    to assure him, I forgot not his tears, and wish him to be not only an almost, but an altogether christian. Dear Sir, you are young and in the bloom of youth, and it would rejoice my heart to see you triumph over the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, and to become a poor despised servant of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Others, indeed, may wish you wealth, may wish you pomp and grandeur; but believe me, my dear friend, these will not, these cannot, make you happy: No, nothing but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    can satisfy the heart of man; nothing but an assurance, that we are born again, that we are members of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    that we are united to him by one and the same spirit with which he himself was actuated. Without this, if we were to have our appetites regaled with the richest dainties, be cloathed with purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day, yet the hand-writing upon the wall, the consideration, that all these things are quickly to be taken away, would make our visage to change, and our knees, like <i>Belshazzar</i>’s, to smite one against another. Strive then, my dear friend, to get the
    <a id="p040"></a>spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    who will keep close to you, when all other comforts fail; will make you happy here, and unspeakably happy hereafter.—Never fear the contempt you will meet with; yet a little while, and they that call you fool, will call themselves so, and curse that worldly wisdom, which tempted them to evade the cross of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Strange! that any one should let a little reproach deprive them of an eternal crown! <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    what is man! How blind as to the knowledge of his true interest! How backward in the pursuit of his eternal good! O, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――,
    let us not be of the number of those, who desire the honour that cometh of man; but be content with that which cometh from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    In a short time, we shall have praise enough. Heaven will echo with the applause that shall be given to the true followers of the Lamb, and then you will see how sincerely I was, dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH through excess of business, and the shortness of the time, that was allotted me, I wrote but a few lines to you from <i>Gibraltar</i>, yet, what hinders, but that I may send you a longer letter now? It’s true we are now near a thousand miles from <i>Georgia</i>; but as I shall have an opportunity of sending immediately on our arrival, I chuse to take time by the forelock, and embrace the first opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    and her husband; for whom I pray without ceasing. Your past favours are seldom out of my mind; I plead them daily before <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in prayer, and hope, if it is ever in my power, I shall imitate the example of pious <i>David</i> in yesterday evening’s first lesson, and requite my friends, particularly dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    and her spouse, for the kindnesses they have shewn me. However, supposing this should not happen, they will in no-wise lose their reward. But I know you do not care I should dwell on this. You want to be informed, how <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has dealt with me since I left <i>Gibraltar</i>? Exceeding graciously indeed. He has comforted
    <a id="p041"></a>me on every occasion, most remarkably blessed my unworthy ministry on board the ship, sent us most delightful weather, and made us to ride as it were on the wings of the wind. We live in perfect love and harmony one with another. I know but little difference between sea and land, and have great reason to bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for sending me abroad. A grievous sickness has been sent amongst us, by which most of the ship have been chastened and corrected but only two given over unto death; and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath been so good to me, that, except for a little time after we sailed from <i>Gibraltar</i>, I have been in perfect health, and now <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    satisfieth my mouth with good things, making me strong and lively as a young eagle. I have nothing to disturb my joy in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    but the disorder of my passions. Were these once brought into a proper subjection to divine grace, O well would it be with me, and happy should I be. But so long as I am angry for trifles, and throw myself into needless disorders, so long must my heart be like the troubled sea, so long consequently must I be unhappy. Pray therefore, dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    that I may lay the ax of mortification to the root of my most darling corruptions, and since I have but little, if any thing, to disturb me without, O pray that I may meet with no disturbance from myself within. The farther particulars of my voyage, you will see in my journal, which I have sent to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Hutton</i>,
    and for the blessings contained therein, I beseech you to return <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    most humble and hearty thanks. About <i>Christmas</i> next, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose to come to <i>England</i> to take priests orders, and to return as soon as possible to <i>Georgia</i>. In the mean while, dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    let us strive to enter in at the strait gate, that we may be christians indeed, and know what it is truly to be born again from above, and to be renewed by the spirit in our minds. Remember me most affectionately to all friends. I am,</p>

    <a id="p042"></a>won my affections. I make mention of you and your’s continually at the throne of grace in my prayers, and shall have no greater pleasure than to hear you walk in the truth. In your last, I think you said, you would desist from frequenting any other societies, but what immediately tended to the promoting of true religion, and ere now, I doubt not but you have seen the benefit of it. I have often pleased myself with the hopes, that you, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――,
    had set up another society among yourselves, and often have I thought, I felt the benefit of your prayers; for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath blessed me exceedingly, and brought us on our way rejoicing; and has shewn me, that he doth not send me abroad in vain.—How <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will deal with me at <i>Savannah</i>, I know not; however, let my friends be always lifting up their hands in intercession, and then our spiritual <i>Amalek</i> will not prevail. Hitherto I have been made to go on from conquering to conquer. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gives me a chearful spirit, and crowns my feeble labours with success. And why should I despair of future assistance? Are not these earnests of future mercies? And may I not expect, when I am duly prepared, to see greater things than these? Cry therefore mightily unto the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    that I may be humble, and that I may tremble at his word, and then he will delight to honour me. I live in hopes of seeing you and your wife again (growing in grace) in <i>England</i>. You told me, she desired I would draw her picture; but alas! she has applied to an improper limner. However, though I cannot describe what she is, I can tell what she ought to be.—Meek, patient, long-suffering, obedient in all things, not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, swift to hear, slow to speak, and ready to every good word and work. But I can no more, I dare not go on in telling another what she ought to be, when I want so much myself; only this I know, when possessed of those good qualities before-mentioned, she will then be as happy as her heart can wish, and afford great reason of thanksgiving to, dear <abbr

      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been pleased graciously to visit me with a violent fever, which he notwithstanding so sweetened by divine consolations, that I was enabled to rejoice and sing in the midst of it. Indeed, I had many violent conflicts with the powers of darkness, who did all they could to disturb and distract me; but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    prayed for me: And though I was once reduced to the last extremity, and all supernatural assistance seemed to be suspended for a while, and satan as it were had dominion over me, yet <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    suffered not my faith to fail; but came in at length to my aid, rebuked the tempter, and from that moment I grew better. Surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is preparing me for something extraordinary: For he has now sent me such extraordinary conflicts and comforts as I never before experienced. I was as I thought on the brink of eternity. I had heaven within me; I thought of nothing in this world; I earnestly desired to be dissolved and go to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>; but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased to order it otherwise, and I am resigned, though I can scarce be reconciled to come back again into this vale of misery. I had the heavenly <i>Canaan</i> in full view, and hoped I was going to take possession of it; but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    saw I was not yet ripe for glory, and therefore in mercy spared me, that I may recover my spiritual strength before I go hence and am no more seen. Oh pray, my dear friend, that I may not grow lukewarm, or slothful, but arise from my late bed of sickness, and administer with ten times more alacrity to my blessed Master, than ever I did before. I would write more, but my strength faileth me. We hope to be at <i>Savannah</i> on <i>Monday</i>.</p>

    are mere painted lions in the way, and to a soul filled with divine love not worth mentioning. The country, mornings and evenings, is exceeding pleasant, and there are uncommon improvements made (considering the indifference of the soil) in divers places. With a little assistance the country people would do very well. As for my ministerial office, I can inform you, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    (such is his goodness) sets his seal to it here, as at other places. We have an excellent christian school, and near a hundred constantly attend at evening prayers. The people receive me gladly, as yet, into their houses, and seem to be most kindly affected towards me. I have a pretty little family, and find it possible to manage a house without distraction. Provisions we do not want to feed on, though we are cut off from all occasions to pamper our bodies. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I visit from house to house, catechise, read prayers twice and expound the two second lessons every day; read to a house-ful of people three times a week; expound the two lessons at five in the morning, read prayers and preach twice, and expound the catechism to servants, <abbr

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    before men.—You have not been ashamed of the cross.—No, dear <abbr

    has put his hand to the plough; he will not, surely he cannot look back; but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    alone can keep me and my dear friend from falling. He has begun and he will carry on, he will finish the good work in our souls.—We have nothing to do, but to lay hold on him by faith, and to depend on him for wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption. Not but we must be workers together with him; for a true faith in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    will not suffer us to be idle.—No, it is an active, lively, restless principle; it fills the heart, so that it cannot be easy, till it is doing something for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.—Methinks
    I hear my dear friend crying out, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    evermore give me this faith!” Believe me, I heartily say, <i>Amen</i>. Ask then, my dear Sir, and it shall be given you, seek and strive for it, and yet a little while and I shall see you a new creature; your heart I hope is somewhat broken already.—All praise be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s free grace in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.—Go
    on, my dear friend, and never cease till you know you are <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s,
    by the spirit that shall be given you. Never fear your carnal friends, renounce
    <a id="p048"></a>them and every thing else that stands in competition with your duty to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.—What
    have we to do to know any one after the flesh? Let him, who doth the will of our Father in heaven, be our brother, our sister, our mother. For this reason I subscribe myself, dear Sir,</p>

    <i>My dear Brethren in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span></i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, and therefore write to you this second letter. I find more and more that satan has desired to have some of you in particular, that he may sift you as wheat, and will strive if possible to divide and separate you all.—I hear there is a woman among you, who pretends to the spirit of prophecy, and what is more unaccountable, I hear that Brother ―― (whom I love in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>)
    seems to approve of her. Need therefore, great need have you, my brethren, at this time to take the apostle’s advice, and to try the spirits whether they be of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    For the devil is beginning to mimic <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    work, and because terrors will not do, he is now transforming himself into an angel of light in order more effectually to gain his point. Brother ―― also, I cannot but think, at present is under a spirit of delusion. He, as well as brother ――, I believe imagines there will be a power given to work miracles, and that now <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is coming to reign a thousand years upon the earth.—But alas! what need is there of miracles, such as healing sick bodies, and restoring sight to blind eyes, when we see greater miracles every day done by the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    word? Do not the spiritually blind now see? Are not the spiritually dead now raised, and the leprous souls now cleans’d, and have not the poor the gospel preached unto them? And if we have the thing already, which such miracles were only intended to introduce, why should we tempt <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in requiring further
    <a id="p051"></a>signs? He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. And as for our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    coming at this time to reign upon the earth, I answer, it is not for us to know the times and seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.—That a great work is begun is evident, that it will be carried on I doubt not; but how it will end, I know not, neither do I desire to know. It is sufficient for me to do the work of the day in its day, and to rest satisfied in this, that all will end in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    glory. Lately, brother ―― told me he was shortly, he believed, to be called to some public work.—I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    he may not run before he is called. To teach, I know, is a pleasing thing; but to begin to teach too soon or without a commission, will be destruction to ourselves, and of ill consequence to others. Uzzah might mean well, when he touched the ark, but his good intention did not preserve him from the just judgments of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Be not many masters, says the apostle. Oh that that verse was deeply engraven on the tables of our hearts! My dear brethren, be not offended at this plainness of speech. I would all the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    servants were prophets, but then I would not have people think themselves prophets of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    when they are only enthusiasts—If <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――
    is acted by a good spirit, why is he not patient of reproof? Why does he fly in a passion, when contradicted? Why does he pretend to be infallible, and that <span
      class="smcap">God</span> always speaks in him? May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give us all a right judgment in all things. Pure unfeigned love causes me to use this freedom. Many of you <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has worked upon by my ministry, and therefore I would not have you ignorant of satan’s devices. O beware of him at this time. Do not conceive prejudices against each other. Do not dispute, but love; purge out the old leaven from amongst you. Have no fellowship with any that converse with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――.
    If they have a mind to depart from you, let them depart. Do you build up each other in your most holy faith. My dear brethren,</p>

    is praying for you, and your faith shall not fail. Your master hath been in the wilderness before you, and knows by experience, how to succour those that are tempted. Lift up then the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees. Infidel books have poisoned your understanding, and rivetted great pride therein. Strong temptations are necessary to mortify that pride, and to teach you that lowliness of heart, which our <span

    calls all that are weary and heavy laden to learn of him. Look up then to <span

    the author and finisher of your faith. He will send you help in every time of need. Indeed he will never leave you, nor forsake you. Follow him as the poor <i>Syrophœnician</i> woman did, and though he may now turn away his face seemingly for a while, yet he will always support you inwardly by a living faith, and shortly give you the spirit of adoption, whereby you will be enabled to cry, “Abba, Father.” I speak this by happy experience. I have mourned, but now I am comforted. I have gone through the spirit of bondage, and, for ever be adored <span

      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    Though I die for him, yet, I beseech you, honoured Sir, to pray that I may not in any way deny him. But what
    <a id="p055"></a>am I doing? I fear, honoured Sir, I am too free. A sense of your humility and love for the blessed <span

    makes me thus open. How should I rejoice, if you would honour me with a line.—I am young, and therefore a word of exhortation and advice, would much profit, honoured Sir,</p>

Fain would I love my master, and will not go from him; his service is perfect freedom; his yoke is easy, his burden light. Still he is pleased to shew us greater things.

Surely it cannot be!—And yet I must believe it.—But if any one had told my dear friend, that he would have behaved thus, would he not have cried out, “Is thy servant a dog that he should do this?” Oh, my dear friend, I am in pain for you! Alas! who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth? You did run well; who, or what hath hindered you? Not a fear of man, I hope; not a desire of that praise, that cometh of man. I know the time when my dear friend’s heart stood stedfast. I know the time when my dear friend was willing to be accounted a fool for <span

    was set for the falling and rising again of many in <i>Israel</i>. Our <span

    as a poor lost sinner, he will do well.—The bishop of <i>London</i> has lately wrote against me; I trust <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath assisted me in writing an answer.—It is now in the press.—All the self-righteous are up
    <a id="p063"></a>in arms.—My Master makes me more than a conqueror through his love. <abbr

    has about forty societies in <i>Yorkshire</i>. Both the <abbr

    <i>Wesley</i>’s go on well.—Go where you will, religion (either for or against it) is the talk.—Probably a suffering time will come. You will not be ashamed of me, though I should be a prisoner. Perhaps you will be put to the trial: But how does my dear friend’s heart? Have you found <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>?
    Does he live in you, so as to be the alpha and omega, the beginning and end of all your actions? Are you enlightened to see the exceeding great riches and fulness of his grace? Oh how will it rejoice my soul to see you a proficient in the school of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>?
    How will it delight me to see your little flock pressing towards the mark.—Soon after this reaches <i>Georgia</i>, I hope to see you.—My stay will be as short as possible at <i>Philadelphia</i>. I must not delay coming to my dear, though poor charge.—I expect to find <i>Savannah</i> almost desolate; but our extremity is <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    opportunity. I believe it will lift up its drooping head.—For the present, my dear friend, farewell.</p>

But do not, my dear brother, I beseech you, dispute against your own happiness.—Be not unwilling to confess that you are not yet a christian. Remember what our <span

    <a id="p064"></a>have been, I think, frequently convinced; but nature, I find, has as frequently interposed, and persuaded you that you had gone far enough already.—But does not my dear brother find, that he yet lacks something? Have not his tempers and corruptions; nay, hath not sin itself dominion over him? Are his affections weaned from the world? Does he feel himself a poor lost sinner? Is he willing the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    should be his whole righteousness? Is he convinced of the freeness, as well as of the riches of his grace? You see, my dear brother, how freely I deal with you. It is because I love you with a peculiar love.—Never did my heart exult at the sight of any relation, as at the sight of you; Surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    intends to give me my dear brother. He is already an almost; hasten, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    that blessed time, when he shall be an altogether christian, and let thy kingdom, with full power, come into my dear brother’s heart!—How shall I say farewell? If you have opportunity, pray write to</p>

Since my retirement from the world, I have seen more and more how full I am of corruption. Nothing could possibly support my soul under the many agonies which oppressed me, when on board, but a consideration of the freeness, eternity, and unchangeableness of <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    increase you more and more, both you and your children. <i>Scotland</i>, like <i>England</i>, hath been so much settled upon it’s lees for some time, that I fear our late days may properly be called the midnight of the church. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, the Father of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    who hath sent forth many of his servants with this cry, “Behold the bridegroom cometh.” Thousands obey the call, and are trimming their spiritual lamps, in order to go forth to meet him.

    and of glory will rest upon us. In patience possess your souls, and I will leave my cause to <span

Oh, strive together with me in your prayers, that the divine strength may be still magnified in my weakness. You will intreat the <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    will yet fulfil his whole will in you. But let not my dear friend linger any longer. If there is mercy with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    let him be feared, not disobeyed. If he has promised to heal our backslidings, and love us freely, let his goodness lead us to repentance. Prosperity hath been a snare to you; every day I see the excellency of that part of <i>Agur</i>’s, prayer, “Give me not riches, lest I be full and deny thee, and say, who is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.”
    And that petition in our liturgy, “In all time of our wealth, good <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    deliver us.” I always take particular notice of it. I believe you will not be at all richer this year, than you was the last.—For as riches increase, our wants increase with them.—I write not this to have you desert your station, but to excite a holy jealousy in your heart.—Oh, what would I give to see my dear friend, as formerly, “Fervent in spirit, serving the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.” If <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    sends me to <i>England</i> again, I shall try my friends. However that be, I am persuaded, that suffering for righteousness sake, is the best, the greatest preferment in the church of <span

    But how does your little—I would not willingly say, your great idol. Pray accept a quarto bible for
    <a id="p069"></a>him. Oh, my friend, give him up to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and do not provoke him, by over-fondness and too great indulgence, to take him from you. The little lambs on board improve bravely; they bear the voyage best of all. They are as lusty as eagles: <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has dealt most gently with us. I hope I may say, the church in my house salute you and your wife.—I do not forget her; may she never rest till she comes into the glorious liberty of the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    It is a blessed thing, my dear friend, to be the <span

Indeed sometimes he has been pleased to withdraw from me, and to permit satan to send me a thorn in the flesh.—But that was only to shew me my vileness, and to prepare me for further manifestations of his goodness to my soul. Our voyage though long has not been tedious or burdensome. My soul wants retirement.—I dread coming out into the world again. I am confident, dear Madam, that you will pray for me, that I may be kept unspotted from it. Oh what a blessed Master do we serve! His rod as well as staff comforts the soul. His corrections are all loving, and are only intended to make us truly great. Though you seemed to doubt, yet I hope to see you once more before you go hence. I cannot say I expect liberty long, if I speak boldly the truth as I ought to speak.—Indeed there is no being a true christian, and yet holding with the world, so much as some may imagine. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    calls us to simplicity. I have often thought, dear Madam, that you did not see through the world enough. Numbers are accounted christians, who have only a name to live. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to open all our eyes, that we may see every thing clearly. A time of persecution will show who are <i>Israelites</i> indeed, and who outside professors.—I hope, Madam, that, when tried, you will come forth as gold purified seven times in the fire. I only fear for, and suspect myself.—The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    my righteousness will uphold me. Dear Madam, <span

    it is a difficult thing to believe aright; it can only be given from above. I know many of my acquaintance, who love to hear me talk and preach, and who receive me gladly into their houses; but alas! I fear they are self-righteous, and were never yet truly convinced of sin. They have good desires, and therefore flatter themselves, that they are good christians: But I fear many of them are only foolish virgins. I would not have dear <abbr

    or her husband of this number. If she hath followed on to know the <span

      class="smcap">God</span> to rely only on <span

    Not merely because my brother told me so, but because I have it under his own hand. Your last kind letter has knit my heart most closely to you. I love those that thunder out the word. The christian world is in a deep sleep. Nothing but a loud voice can awaken them out of it. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to strengthen you more and more, and cause you to triumph in every place. Though absent in body, I am present with you in spirit. It would rejoice me to hear of your success in the <span

    In about a twelvemonth I purpose, <span

    Methinks I would be always upon the wing; but alas! I have a body of sin, which at times makes me cry out, “who shall deliver me?” I thank <span

    at all times at peace with him, and assured that my sins are forgiven. I want to leap my seventy years; I long to be dissolved, and to be with <span

    and the attentive people receiving joyfully the gracious words, which proceed out of his mouth. Go on, my dear brother, go on; may the <span

If not, I must resign the parsonage, and take upon me only the care of the orphans. I intend bringing up two or three, that are with me, for the ministry: more, no doubt, will shortly be added to their number. If you could come and teach them the languages, for an hour or two in the day; we could serve both the orphan-house and parsonage together. Great things I trust will come out of <i>Georgia</i>.

    I remember you in my unworthy prayers, and am persuaded I am not forgotten in your’s. No one more needs them, whether considered as a private christian, or a public minister; thousands are waiting for my halting; and I know so much of the corruption of my own heart, that was <span

A public life is attended with innumerable snares; and a sense of my unworthiness and unfitness so weighs me down, that I have often thought it would be best for me to retire.

    why should I not tell what he hath done for my soul, for the encouragement of others. By the help of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I will speak; and the more satan bids me to hold my peace, the more earnestly will I proclaim to believing saints, that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    the son of <i>David</i> will have mercy on them; nay, I do not despair of publishing these glad tidings even at <i>Wethersfield</i>. In a little above a twelvemonth, <span

    willing, I intend returning. But ere that time comes, I trust my dear <span

    will purge me, that I may bring forth more fruit.—Satan has not been wanting to sift me as wheat; but my friend, the friend of all, even <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    has prayed for me, and as yet my faith hath not failed. Oh had I a thousand lives, my dear <span

    should have them all! For he is worthy, he hath plucked me as a brand out of the burning, and is continually comforting me on every side—Read, read, dear Sir, the account I have sent over to be published of what <span

    as a proof of it, I send this. I heartily wish I could correspond with you oftener. Your advice would always be seasonable to me; because you have been a long time in the school of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I am but just now entering the list, and frequently tremble at the consideration of what I am to do and suffer.—But when I consider it is for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    who has called me by his free grace into his marvellous light, and has promised to be with us always, even unto the end of the world, a divine
    <a id="p078"></a>fire kindles in my heart, and I long to call the lingring battle on. Satan hath been busy with me since I saw you, especially since my retirement on ship-board. I have often thought of the folly of those, who go out of the world to avoid temptation. Satan now buffets me more than when confined in a ship. I receive this as a great mercy at the hands of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    to keep me in action, and to prepare me for greater tokens of his love. Before I am exalted, I am always humbled by some inward trials. They are the most soul-grieving, but they are the most soul-improving conflicts. My dear friend, I can say from my heart, “I am the chief of sinners:” I feel myself so wretched and miserable, so blind and naked in myself, that satan would tempt me to write to no one. But the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath rebuked him, and after a long tedious hour of temptation, fills my soul as it were with marrow and fatness, and maketh my pen the pen of a ready writer. Oh that my mouth was filled with his praise! As yet, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    in my darkest hours my evidences have not been in the least clouded. I have been assured my <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath forgiven all my iniquities, transgressions and sins, but I cannot forgive myself. Oh that I should ever offend against such dying love! Pray for me, my dear brother, pray for me, that I may never by pride or sloth tempt the blessed spirit to depart from me. I fear not falling finally; for <span
      class="smcap">God</span> I believe chose me in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    before ever the earth and the world were made, as a vessel of his saving mercy; but I fear I shall provoke him to let me fall foully, and then how will the <i>Philistines</i> rejoice? This consideration sometimes makes me to wish that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    would cut off my strength in my journey, and shorten my days. But wherefore do I fear? Ah me of little faith! You see, my dear friend, how freely I have unbosomed my heart to you. I cannot call you my friend, and yet hide from you <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    dealings with my soul. Salute all that love our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    in sincerity, and beseech them to pray for your sincere friend, but the most unprofitable of his dear <span

The <i>Quakers</i>, though wrong in their principles, yet I think have left us an example of patient suffering, and did more by their bold, unanimous and persevering testimonies, than if they had taken up all the arms in the kingdom. In this respect I hope I shall follow them as they did <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and though I die for him, yet take up no carnal weapon in defence of him in any wise. The doctrines of our election, and free justification in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    are daily more and more pressed upon my heart. They fill my soul with a holy fire, and afford me great confidence in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    my Saviour. Surely I am safe, because put into his almighty arms. Though I may fall, yet I shall not utterly be cast away. The spirit of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    will hold, and uphold me. That <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may every day enrich you more and more with the anointings of this spirit, is the hearty prayer of, Reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    weep over the desolations of the university wherein you live. Alas! how is that once faithful city become an harlot! Have pity upon her, ye that are friends, and whatever treatment you may meet with from an ungrateful world, endeavour at least to rescue some of her sons out of that blindness, ignorance, bigotry and formality, into which she is unhappily fallen.

    kindling, all the devils in hell shall not be able to extinguish it. Be not therefore, my brethren, weary of well doing. Have you true faith? keep it not to yourselves; be willing, as occasion offers, freely to communicate it to others. How will you be apt to teach hereafter, unless you begin to teach now? None but those, who are of a different spirit from that meek man <i>Moses</i>, will be offended at you. All <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been pleased to bless my ministry to your souls, so I think it my duty to watch over you for good, and assure you, constantly you are all upon my heart. Your last letter gave me great pleasure; but it was too full of acknowledgments, which I by no means deserve. To him alone, from whom every good and perfect gift cometh, be all the thanks and glory; I heartily pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that you may be burning and shining lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation. Though you are not of the church of <i>England</i>, yet if you are persuaded in your own minds of the truth of the way wherein you now walk, I leave it. However, whether <i>Conformists</i>, or <i>Nonconformists</i>, our main concern should be, to be assured that we are called and taught of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    for none but such are fit to minister in holy things. Indeed, my dear brethren, it rejoiced me much to see such dawnings of grace in your souls; only I thought most of you were bowed down too much with a servile fear of man: but as the love of the Creator increases, the fear of the creature will daily decrease in your hearts. <i>Nicodemus</i>, who came at first by night to our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    afterwards dared to own him before the whole council in open day. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    make you all thus minded. For unless your hearts are free from worldly hopes and worldly fears, you never will speak boldly, as you ought to speak. The good old <i>Puritans</i>, I believe, never preached better, than when in danger of being taken to prison as soon as they had finished their sermon. And however the church may be at peace now, yet I am persuaded, unless you go forth with the same temper, you will never preach with the same demonstration of the spirit, and of power. Study therefore, my brethren, I beseech you by the mercies of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    study your hearts as well as books—ask yourselves again and again, whether you would preach for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    if you were sure to lay down your lives for so doing? If you fear the displeasure of a man for doing your duty now, assure
    <a id="p082"></a>yourselves you are not yet thus minded. But enough of this. I love to hope well of you all. I trust, as you are enlightened with some degree of knowledge in the mysteries of godliness, you will henceforth determine not to know any thing but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and him crucified. This is, and this, the <span

Neither the cares of the world, nor the deceitfulness of riches, I trust have been permitted to choak, and hinder the growth of it in your soul. Indeed, Madam, you cannot be too watchful. It is a blessed, and careful thing, to be a true Christian. The first step to it

      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    for righteousness, sanctification and eternal redemption. Thousands indeed place christianity in good desires, and the having good desires; but this and much more a person may have, and yet miscarry at last. Pure and undefiled religion consists in a lively faith in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    as the only mediator between <span

    and man. A faith that changes and renews the whole soul, takes it entirely off the world, and fixes it wholly upon <span

    This, Madam, is the faith that you have so often heard me preach, and of which I pray <span

    you may be a partaker. Though you have it not yet, you need not despair; <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will give it to all who sincerely ask of him. It is true, Madam, that not many mighty are called; but it is not your riches shall keep you from heaven if you truly believe on the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    Faith in him will enable you to overcome the world, and cause you even to triumph over the lust of the eye and the pride of life. Faith will set you above the fear of man, and enable you to rejoice in being accounted a fool for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s sake. That <span

    As fast as I can, the rest of our Welch friends shall hear from me. Oh that I may never forget their works of faith and labours of love! Salute them most affectionately in my name; and exhort them, my dear brother, to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. Put them in mind of the freeness and eternity of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    electing love, and be instant with them, to lay hold on the perfect righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    by faith. Talk to them, oh talk to them, even till midnight, of the riches of his all-sufficient grace. Tell them, oh tell them, what he has done for their souls, and how earnestly he is now interceding for them in heaven. Shew them in the map of the word, the kingdoms of the upper world, and the transcendent glories of them; and assure them all shall be theirs, if they believe on <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    with their whole hearts. Press them to believe on him immediately. Intersperse prayers with your exhortations, and thereby call down fire from heaven, even the fire of the Holy Ghost,</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>AS not my heart with your heart, when we rode by the way and talked to each other concerning the Scriptures? I thought our souls tallied together, and that we had both drank of the same spirit. I have often, since that time, admired the grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in you, and even now feel my soul, whilst I am writing, intimately united with yours. What is all this, but the effect and fruit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s everlasting love through <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span> our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    What is it, but an instance of the sovereign will and good pleasure of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy? Oh how doth the free, the distinguishing grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    excite the love of those, who are made partakers of it! What was there in you and in me, dear <i><abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> O――</i>,
    that should move <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to chuse us before others? Was there any fitness foreseen in us, except a fitness for damnation? I believe not. No, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    chose us from eternity, he called us in time, and I am persuaded will keep us from falling finally, till time shall be no more. Consider the Gospel in this view, and it appears a consistent scheme, though directly contrary to the natural man; and nothing convinces me more of the truth of these doctrines, than the enmity that is in the heart of carnal minds against them. However, the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is able to pull down every thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>.
    Henceforward I hope I shall speak boldly and plainly as I ought to speak, and not fail to declare the whole counsel of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I pray daily, that I may know his will more perfectly, not only that I may do it myself, but
    <a id="p091"></a>that I may teach it to others. If I die for it, I cannot but speak the things which I know. Oh my dear friends, lift up your hands for me in the sanctuary. The prayers of the faithful, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will hear. Entreat the same favour of your brother. I love you both in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and remember you often when I go in and out before the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>:
    He has been with us in the ship. His rod has corrected, his staff has comforted us; both his rod and staff have edified and strengthened our souls. In a year’s time I hope to see <i>England</i>. My love to all friends, and beseech them to pray that I may be prepared for whatever awaits</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>
    has highly favoured me in the acquaintance of numbers of his dearest children. I cannot see some, and to but few of them can I write, on account of other business. Hasten, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    that blessed time, when we shall all sit down to eat bread in thy kingdom!—My dear Sister, pray that I may patiently wait till my change shall come. I want to leap my seventy years. I long to be dissolved to be with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Sometimes it arises from a fear of falling, knowing what a body of sin I carry about me. Sometimes, from a prospect of future labours and sufferings, I am out of humour, and wish for death as <i>Elijah</i> did: At others, I am tempted, and then I long to be freed from temptations. But it is not thus always: There are times when my soul hath such foretastes of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that I long more eagerly to be with him; and the frequent prospect of the happiness which the spirits of just men made perfect now enjoy, often carries me as it were into another world. Many such sweet meditations hath my soul been favoured with; but in the midst of all, I have felt, and do feel, that I am the chief of sinners. A mystery of iniquity
    <a id="p092"></a>that lay in my heart undiscovered, has been opened to my view, since my retirement in the ship. May he enlighten me more and more, to know and feel the mystery of his electing, soul-transforming love. Nothing like that, to support us under present, and all the various future trials which await us. But the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has apprehended us, and will not let us go. Men and devils may do their worst; our <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will suffer nothing to pluck us out of his Almighty hands; for he has loved us with an everlasting love, and therefore his right-hand shall uphold us. By his assistance, we shall hold out to the end. By his grace, I, you, and all his chosen ones shall finally be saved. Then, my dear Sister, shall we converse, not with ink and paper, but face to face. Then, but not till then, shall we fully know what a legion of devils <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    hath cast out of our souls, and how, after all our strivings against, and quenching many of the motions of his spirit, he at last brought us to glory. Cease not to pray for</p>

    sheep are scattered abroad, having too, too few true shepherds; I beseech you, go on, and point out to them the Redeemer’s good pastures. Say not, wherewithal shall I feed them? The great shepherd shall furnish you with food enough, and to spare. Give of your loaves, and you shall take up of the fragments that remain. To him that hath, shall be given. Satan no doubt will resist you; he will bid you, out of a false humility, to hold your peace; but let my friend speak out boldly as he ought to speak. The Holy Spirit will give him utterance, and apply the word to the hearers. If prayers may water the good seed, you may depend on mine. I remember the dear <i>Bedford</i> people.

    <i>Dear Brother K.</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Long to hear how it is with you, and the church in your house. I verily believe, though it is but a little flock, yet it will be our heavenly Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. How happy is it, when all are of one mind in a house; all agreed to entertain and love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    Their heaven is begun on earth. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to continue this blessing, and cause you daily to build up each other in the knowledge of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and Saviour <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    He is a gracious Master. Oh that I knew and loved him more! for he is altogether lovely. Has he yet revealed himself in dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>K.</i>’s
    heart? Is he assured that his beloved is his? Is he brought into the glorious liberty of the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    Is his mind free from scruples? Is he active? Is he punctual? Is he strong in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    and in the power of his might? Is the meekness of the lamb and the boldness of the lion blended in his soul? Do his parishioners fear, yet love him? Is he a <i>Boanerges</i>, and yet a <i>Barnabas</i> in the church of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    Does he thunder against obstinate sinners, and by displaying the riches of the promises, comfort and build up the saints? Does he preach as the spirit gives him utterance? Can he rely on the promise, “Lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the world?”</p>
  <p>
    Forgive this freedom, my dear brother. Love makes me thus impertinent. I want to see you perfect, entire, lacking nothing. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    from day to day supply what is still deficient
    <a id="p097"></a>in you and in me, till we come to the fulness of the measure of the stature of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    He is faithful that has promised. <span

Oh shew them forth more and more by your works, and let the world see what it is to have a faith working by love. Study, oh study, day by day, the simplicity of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Cast away every thing from you that savours of the lust of the eye and pride of life. Be quick to hear, slow to speak, and let your conversation always be seasoned with grace. Oh, dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>F.</i>
    my heart is enlarged towards you: My kind, my liberal hostess, what shall I say or do to express my gratitude? I will, I do speak for you to the king of kings. Though I am so great a sinner, he frequently admits me into his privy chamber, and then I often sigh out, “O that my dear <i>Hertford</i> friends may live

    suffers his dear children to fall into little miscarriages, that the eye may not say to the hand, “I have no need of thee;” or again, the head to the foot, “I have no need of thee.” We must be helps to each other on this side eternity. Nothing gives me more comfort, next to the assurance of the eternal continuance of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    love, than the pleasing reflection of having so many christian friends to watch with my soul. I wish they would smite me friendly, and reprove me oftner than they do; I would force my proud heart to thank them. But I am amazed at your coming off so triumphantly. Surely the devil is asleep, or rather that roaring lion thinks to break out upon us with double fury hereafter. It often shames me, when I read <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>’s
    account of his sufferings, to think in how few particulars I can as yet sympathize with him. It as often makes me long to be like him, and yet I fear how I shall act when put to the trial. This, however, is my comfort, “<span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.” He saw me from all eternity; he gave me being; he called me in time; he has freely justified me through faith in his blood; he has in part sanctified me by his spirit; he will preserve me underneath his everlasting arms, till time shall be no more. Oh the blessedness of these evangelical truths! These are indeed gospel; they are glad tidings of great joy to all that have ears to hear. These, bring the creature out of himself. These, make him to hang upon the promises, and cause his obedience to flow from a principle of love. They are meat indeed, and drink indeed unto my soul. I am persuaded they are so likewise

I am acquainted in some measure with the strugglings of a soul just awakening into new life. I know too many have stifled their convictions, and therefore am importunate on your behalf. I hope you have taken my advice, and laid the ax to the root of the tree. Oh pray for a new heart and a new spirit, and then all old things will subside and give way of themselves. The strong man armed must go out when the stronger than he, even the spirit of <span

    You need not doubt his holding out the golden sceptre to you. Whosoever cometh to him by faith, he will in no-wise cast out. He calls, he draws you: what is it for, but to assure you he will make you happy? Come then, dear Sir, weary and heavy laden as you are, the <span

    your righteousness shall give you rest: He shall refresh you with a multitude of peace, and cause you to rejoice in his salvation; there is nothing too hard for the <span

    He can draw your mind from the creature, he can fix it upon himself; he can enable you to live above the world, whilst you are in it; he can translate you to heaven, when he has taken you away from earth. As the

    Your great kindness, in publicly praying for me, can never be sufficiently acknowledged. The thought almost makes me to weep for joy. Surely the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will not let me miscarry, since he has stirred up the choicest of his servants to intercede in my behalf. The searcher of all hearts alone knows, what agonies my poor soul has undergone since my retirement from the world. The remembrance of my past sins has overwhelmed my soul, and caused tears to be my meat day and night. Indeed I have mourned as one mourneth for a first born: But I looked to him whom I have pierced. I was enabled to see the freeness and riches of his grace, the infiniteness and eternity of his love, and my soul received comfort. Oh the excellency of the doctrine of election, and of the saints final perseverance, to those who are truly sealed by the spirit of promise! I am persuaded, till a man comes to believe and feel these important truths, he cannot come out of himself; but when convinced of these, and assured of the application of them to his own heart, he then walks by faith indeed, not in himself, but in the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who died and gave himself for him. Love, not fear, constrains him to obedience. The promises of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    are all Yea and Amen to his soul. Supported by these convictions, in about a twelvemonth, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I intend returning to <i>England</i>, and to begin my testimony afresh. I trust I shall not be ashamed to declare the whole counsel of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Satan, no doubt, and his emissaries, will endeavour to block up my way; but the saints of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    are praying for me on earth, and the holy <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is interceding in heaven. Why should I
    <a id="p102"></a>not go forth and offer his everlasting and perfect righteousness to all that shall be brought to believe on him? Satan suggests even whilst I am writing, “How canst thou speak, seeing thou art such a sinner?” But therefore will I speak, because I can say, by happy experience, that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    will have mercy on the chief of sinners; for among such you may truly rank</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    moved me to write, I should be silent. When last at <i>Gloucester</i>, I heard you was highly offended at my meetings in the fields, and at the same time countenanced and encouraged the acting of plays in the <i>Boothall</i>. This I thought highly unbecoming the character of a christian magistrate, whose peculiar business it is to be a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that do well. This made me to speak against those proceedings in my sermons. This is the occasion of my troubling you with a letter. I cannot think I have delivered my soul, unless, with all meekness and humility, I exhort you henceforward not to promote or so much as any way countenance the stage-players. In our common law they are stiled <i>sturdy beggars</i>. As a minister of the king, upon that account it is your duty to put a stop to them: As a disciple and minister of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    the king of kings, you are obliged, <i>honoured Sir</i>, to exert your authority in suppressing them. It is notorious that such meetings are the nurseries of debauchery; they are the pest of our nation, and the bane of true christianity: To be present at, or in the least to contribute towards their support, is therefore a great sin; but to countenance them by our authority, and let them act by our permission, what is this
    <a id="p104"></a>but becoming public patrons for vice and immorality? It is not only sinning ourselves, but it is taking pleasure in the sins of others. This the apostle accounted the highest pitch of heathenish wickedness. Honoured Sir, pray be not offended: These are not the words of a madman; no, they are the words of truth and soberness, and words which our <span

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH unknown to you in person, yet as you was pleased to think me worthy of the care of your dear son, I think it my duty to acquaint you of his welfare. I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that he came with me. He is diligent and pious, and I trust will be a comfort to you in your declining years: His mind seems settled and composed, and by reading and following the bible, he is partaker of that peace which the world cannot give. His dear and honoured father is much upon his heart. How would it rejoice him to hear that you also was become a christian indeed? Be not offended, dear Sir, at my expressing myself thus. Assure yourself that christianity is something more than a name and a bare outward profession. Morality of itself, dear Sir, will never carry us to heaven; no, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    is the way, the truth, and the life. There is no being happy without a lively faith in him, wrought in the heart by the blessed spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    This faith transforms the whole man, delivers him from the tyranny of his passions, and makes him entirely a new creature. This is the reason why it is foolishness to the world. Your son’s case in this respect
    <a id="p105"></a>was not singular. As soon as ever we commence christians, we commence fools for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake. Every truly religious man must be deemed a madman. Forgive this freedom, dear Sir; whilst I am writing, I find a love for your soul arising in my heart, and methinks I could do any thing to bring your grey hairs with comfort to the grave. Dear Sir, there is mercy with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    even for those who come in at the eleventh hour. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    came to save poor sinners; he came to save you, dear Sir, if you lay hold on him by a living faith. That <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may give you this faith, and thereby make you happy in time and to eternity, is the hearty prayer of, dear Sir,</p>

Your charity, dear Sir, will excite you to pray that I may not through pride fall into the condemnation of the devil. Dear Sir, shall I come out into the world again or not?

    thoughts are not as our thoughts: However, in about a twelvemonth, by his leave, I hope to return amongst you once more. Oh! that I may come in the blessing of the gospel of peace! The doctrines I have already preached come with double evidence upon my mind day by day. I am more and more convinced that they are the truths of <span

    they agree with the written word, and the experience of all the saints in all ages: Nothing more confirms me in the belief of them, than the opposition that is made against them by natural men. Election, free grace, free justification without any regard to works foreseen, are such paradoxes to carnal minds, that they cannot away with them. This is the wisdom of <span

    which is foolishness with man, and which, the <span

    has been exceeding gracious to me since I saw you last. Oh let your songs be of him, and praise him for all his wonderful works. As I am enabled I remember you and yours.

    Sometimes my weak body gives me hopes, that I shall not be long in the flesh; but then, the strength that is communicated to me, and the consideration, that I have but just begun my testimony, fills me with fears, lest I should live to be greyheaded. But I endeavour to resign myself wholly to <span

    I desire his will may be done in me, by me, and upon me. If the <span

What wonder, if when in their power, they should breathe out slaughters also?

    in behalf of another, if at the same time I am self-righteous myself? I am thus jealous, I trust with a godly jealousy, because I see so many self-deceivers among my acquaintance.

    has done for his soul. He hath excellent good desires and intentions, but I think he wants something more: <span

But love, love for your better part, your soul, your precious soul, this love constrains me to use this freedom. You are more noble than to take it ill at my hands; I could not bear even to suspect that you deceived yourself, dear Sir, and not tell you such a suspicion was in my heart. That <span

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE many favours I have received at your hands, are still deeply impressed upon my heart; as I have often said, so I say again, I hope they will never be forgotten by me so long as I live. But, reverend Sir, I have observed some particulars in your principles and conduct, which I must confess have given me much concern, and of which, from love and
    <a id="p113"></a>gratitude, I think myself obliged to inform you. ―― I believe, dear Sir, you have often been inwardly offended at me, because you suspected, I thought you to be no true christian. Your suspicions were not groundless. I cannot yet think, that a thorough work of conversion was ever wrought upon your soul. I fear you deny, that “<span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> is truly and properly <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    I infer this, from your not reading the <i>Nicene Creed</i>, and your palliating that text I once urged to prove it. “I and my Father are one.” I doubt also, your owning “Original Sin.” This I gather from your wondering I should touch on such a point, when I preached my sermon on justification by <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Besides, the sad definition you once gave of religion in a letter to your brother ――; the stranger also which you seemed to be to the “devil’s temptations,” when I conversed with you; and your supposing, that conversion was to be wrought in the soul by moral persuasion; all these put together, dear Sir, convince me, that you were never yet truly and effectually born again of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Besides, <i>Reverend Sir</i>, does your going weekly to a club, where the company play at cards, and sit up late at night, does this, dear Sir, agree with your holy vocation, either as a christian or a minister? Be not offended, <abbr
      title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
    Sir, at this plainness of speech. I have forborne a long while; love and gratitude would not suffer me to forbear any longer. I wish I had no occasion to write in this manner. I believe you so ingenuous as not to be angry with me. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to quell all resentment in your heart, and send you his holy spirit to guide you into all truth. Your brother’s eyes are now in some measure opened: he is convinced of the perfect righteousness wrought out for him by <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and ere now I hope hath received faith to apply it to his heart. This is the doctrine of the church of <i>England</i>. Unless you hold this and other evangelical principles, how, dear Sir, is it consistent with sincerity to eat her bread? With humility, respect, and love, do I offer these things to your consideration—Be pleased to weigh them in a proper balance, and reflect from what principle they are wrote, and I am persuaded you will not be offended at, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    first brought us together. Oh pray, that what I admire in another, I may imitate myself, and have the graces of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    stamped upon my heart. It fills me with confusion, whenever I consider how far I am from his likeness. Alas! What would become of me, was I to be saved by any thing within myself. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    is my whole righteousness. By virtue of that I know I am justified, I believe I shall be sanctified, and am assured I shall be everlastingly redeemed: for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    loved me with an everlasting love. Oh, dear Sir, the prospect of an hereafter fills my soul with comfort. Then shall I have enough of your company, and of the other children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    give me patience to wait till my blessed change cometh. He often gives me such foretastes of the glory to be revealed in us, that I want to leap my seventy years. But in a degree, I may say with my blessed master, “I have a cup to drink of, and a baptism to be baptized with.” Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    will see me humbled, I believe, as much as once exalted; I look for “Away with him, away with him,” every day. Then, I trust, I shall begin in earnest to be a disciple of <span

    <a id="p115"></a>still, help me, dear Sir, by your prayers. They will be a means of lifting up my hands when they hang down, and of strengthning my feeble knees. Though in all things we do not, yet in essentials we both think and speak the same things. I wish all names among the saints of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    were swallowed up in that one of <i>Christian</i>.—I long for professors to leave off placing religion in saying “I am a Churchman,” “I am a Dissenter.” My language to such is, “Are you of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>?
    If so, I love you with all my heart:” for this reason chiefly, dear Sir, my heart is drawn out towards you. On this account, though so long in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    before me, I make bold to call you brother, and to wish you <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    speed: blessed be his name, you have little reason to cry out; “My leanness, my leanness.” Many gracious souls are among your flock, they love to be fed with the sincere milk of the word. I hope they will be your joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    I often think of them with pleasure; pray salute them most affectionately in my name, and exhort them to entreat the <span

    that I may make full proof of my ministry. In about a twelvemonth, <span

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU cannot conceive how often you have been upon my thoughts, since I saw you. Eternity itself I hope will not diminish, but more and more increase that love, which I bear you from my heart. Your stature reminds me of little <i>Zaccheus</i>: he that called him, I am persuaded hath called you: Have you not heard him say to your soul, “I am your salvation?”
    <a id="p116"></a>If so, fear not, thou art a son of <i>David</i>. Let worldly affairs be ever so bad, he that has given you his own dear Son, will make you more than conqueror in all things. Still dare to own our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    before men. It is no scandal for a follower of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> to be poor. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was poor before us—So that we are rich in faith and good works, it is not much <a
      id="p116a" href="#tn_10">♦</a>matter
    if we are not rich in this world’s goods. Having <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    though we have nothing else, we possess all things. However, since godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, as well as that which is to come, I would advise you to plead the promises for temporal blessings. In the name of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    many a sweet morsel and opportune supply, have I fetched in from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    by this means. That is the way I live, and hope shall continue so to live till death is swallowed up in victory. <i>Death</i>—what a comfortable word is that for a believer! <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    hath taken the sting of it away; henceforward it is no longer a king of terrors, but a welcome messenger to conduct the saints to glory. My dear brother, let us comfort one another with these things. We are not to live here always; our inheritance is above. When <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    who is our life shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory. Why then should we value these light afflictions, which are but for a moment? No, let us patiently bear our cross, since we are so shortly to wear a crown. Oh the riches of free, distinguishing grace! Why were you and I taken into favor? “Even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.” O! my friend, my brother, let us for ever extol free grace! However others exalt man and debase <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, let us exalt <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and debase man. Let <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    have all the glory: for he is the author, carrier on, and finisher of our faith. He hath begun it in time, he shall compleat it in eternity.—My brother, I have been so expanded whilst writing, that I must refer you to other friends, to know how graciously <span

    to be meek and lowly in heart; but my corruptions are so strong, and my employ so dangerous, that sometimes I am afraid. But wherefore do I fear?

The moment you are ripe for our common Master, he shall translate you to glory; <i>I præ, sequar</i>.

I should be obliged to you, if you would be pleased to recommend to me some useful books, especially such which open the holy sacrament; for in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    law is my delight. <i>Boston’s fourfold State of Man</i> I like exceedingly. Under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    it has been of much service to my soul. I believe I agree with you and him in the essential
    <a id="p129"></a>truths of christianity. I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    his spirit has convinced me of our eternal election by the Father through the Son, of our free justification through faith in his blood, of our sanctification as the consequence of that, and of our final perseverance and glorification as the result of all. These I am persuaded <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has joined together; these, neither men nor devils shall ever be able to put asunder. My only scruple at present is, “Whether you approve of taking the sword in defence of your religious rights?” One of our <i>English</i> bishops I remember, when I was with him, called you <i>Cameronians</i>. They, I think, took up arms, which I think to be contrary to the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    and his apostles. Some few passages in your sermon before the presbytery, I thought were a little suspicious of favouring that principle. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    your next may inform me that I am mistaken: For when zeal carries us to such a length, I think it ceases to be zeal according to knowledge. Dearest Sir, be not angry at my writing thus freely. I love, I honour you in the bowels, and for the sake of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    from my soul. I wish you good luck in all your pious undertakings. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to prosper the works of your hands, and to make you a noble instrument in bringing many sons to glory. Pray send an immediate answer, directed as usual, and care will be taken to have it remitted to, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    has been pleased to call you by his grace, and to give you joy in the Holy Ghost: But, my brother, I hope it will be more settled and substantial, and joined with meekness and humility of heart. A joy which is the result of inward trials, and flowing from a long experience of the buffeting of satan. Such a joy will make you apt and fit to teach, and keep you from being puffed up above measure. It will exalt, at the same time as it humbles your soul. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>

    Oh, <i>dear Sir</i>, the care of souls I find to be a matter of the greatest importance. You have a great number committed to your charge. What a dreadful thing will it be for any of them to perish through your neglect? And yet I fear, Sir, you do not walk worthy of the holy vocation wherewith you are called. It is no good report that I hear of you in common life. Your practice contradicts your doctrine, and what good can you do, if every one of your parishioners, whilst you are preaching, may reply, “Physician heal thyself?” Besides, Sir, how can you preach <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    to others, when you are a stranger to his power yourself? It is next to impossible. I make no apology for this plainness of speech. Simplicity becomes embassadors of <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    is my judge how earnestly I long after your salvation, and how willingly I would spend and be spent in order to promote it. Oh how closely does true faith in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    our head, knit all his members in love to one another; what a divine harmony and attraction is there between them, when they have drank into and been made partakers of one and the same spirit? How does the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    dilate and enlarge their hearts! How do all little distinctions about externals fall away, and every other name is swallowed up in the name of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>?
    This, my dear brother, is that catholic spirit, which will cement all denominations of sincere professors together. This is the spirit of which free distinguishing grace has made you a partaker, and which I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    we both may partake of every day more and more. He is faithful who has promised, who also will do it. I find it is not in vain that we have believed in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>. He is <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and his work is perfect; his love is like himself unchangeable; his gifts and callings are without repentance, and therefore, though I am but a babe in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    yet I am persuaded I shall see you crowned with glory. Then, my dear brother, we shall have time enough together. Then, there will be no parting, no fear of falling; but we shall drink eternally of those pleasures which flow from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    right hand for evermore. Supported with this hope, what hinders but I may come once again, when the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> permits, and offer <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    everlasting righteousness to poor perishing sinners. The devil and his servants will rage horribly, and perhaps cast me into prison, nay, put me to death: But if you will come and visit me, by the help of my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I will preach to you even there; for I am not ashamed of the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I have felt it to be the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    unto my salvation. Oh, my brother, the fire kindles whilst I am writing; but I must have done. Pray salute those dear souls that I spoke to at your house, and all
    <a id="p133"></a>other friends. Entreat them to pray and give thanks for me; and assure them they are not forgotten by</p>

    This was the chief end of her going abroad, and give me leave to tell you, this is the chief thing you ought, and must pursue at home. But why do I say at home? A christian hath no home but heaven. He is a stranger and pilgrim while here on earth. I hope you know better, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    than to think you was born to drive a team, or plough a piece of ground. These things must be done, but then they should be done in subordination to the care of your better part, the soul. Your daughter tells me, you are now grey headed. Take heed, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    to make your calling and election sure. Rest not in outward things. Do not flatter yourself that you are a christian, because you go to church, and do no one any harm. Nothing but a living faith in <span

    If you know not what I mean by these terms, you may depend upon it, you are a stranger to this new-birth, and consequently in a state of death: but you need not fear; even at the eleventh hour <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    will accept you, if you come to him by faith. He hath shewn mercy to your son and daughter. Why may he not shew mercy to their father also? Whosoever cometh to him, he will in no-wise cast out. Haste then, dear

      class="smcap">God</span>
    brought us last night; I trust the same gracious being, by his good providence, has conducted you safe to <i>Philadelphia</i>. I cannot say, I have met with so much as even an <i>almost christian</i>, since I parted from you, till I came to <i>Colonel Whiting</i>’s—There, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    put in my way a planter, that is seeking to know the way of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    more perfectly—He is now with us, and I hope our conversation will be blessed unto him. Oh dear <i><abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> B――</i>,
    strive, I beseech you by the mercies of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    strive to enter in at the strait gate. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of late has loudly called you—Take heed that neither the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, nor the pride of life prevail on you to lie down in a carnal security again. I am confident you will be most heartily despised, if you are a real christian; but dear <i><abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> B――</i>’s
    resolution will be built on a better foundation, than to let a little breath blow it down. In <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is your strength; look up to him day by day, and as your day is, so shall your strength be. I fear and pray for you. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows, how often you have been upon my heart. We have not failed interceding for you at the throne of grace. I shall be much mistaken, if <i><abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> B――</i>
    does not prove a christian indeed. About <i>May</i> I propose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to be with you again. Then I shall rejoice to sit and hear you tell what <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has done for your soul—Be not afraid of conviction. Be not afraid of inward feelings. Now pray to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    to lay the ax of mortification to the root of your heart. Make
    <a id="p138"></a>thorough work with it. Do not spare yourself in the least.—Now is the accepted time, and that it may be the day of salvation, is the earnest prayer of, dear <i><abbr

    You are seldom out of my thoughts; but till now I have not had liberty given me, to send you a line—I trust the work goes on gloriously in your parts. The hand of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    brought wondrous things to pass, before we left <i>Pensilvania</i>; but in these parts satan seems to lead people captive at his will. The distance of the plantations prevents people’s assembling themselves together.—Here are no great towns, as in other provinces, and the commonalty is made up of <i>Negroes</i> and <i>convicts</i>, and if they pretend to serve <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    their masters, <i>Pharaoh</i> like, cry out, “Ye are idle, ye are idle.” Last night I read the affecting account of your brother <i>John</i>; let me die, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    the death of that righteous man, and let my future state be like his! O my dear friend, my brother, entreat the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    that I may grow in grace, and pick up the fragments of my time, that not a moment of it may be lost. Teach me, oh teach me the way of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    more perfectly. Rebuke, reprove, exhort me with all authority—I feel I am but a babe in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I long to know more of the holy <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    He has manifested himself to my soul, both in a way of humiliation and exaltation. Since I saw you, both his rod and staff have comforted me. At present, he makes me young and lively as an eagle; I only wish I was more worthy to subscribe myself</p>

    <span class="dropcap">J</span>UST now we have been singing the hymn, which we sung at <i>Broad-oak</i>; and as I generally do at such seasons, I thought of that happy time wherein we sung it in your great hall. It was a time much to be remembered, an anticipation, I believe, of that blessed time when we all shall meet to sing the song of the Lamb in the heavenly Jerusalem—For the adoption of the spirit, if truly received, is the earnest of our promised inheritance. We are sealed thereby to the day of redemption, and therefore may give both men and devils the challenge to separate us, if they can, from the love of <span

    am verily persuaded, that since I left you, all things have worked together for your good. As I am travelling, often does my soul think both of you and yours, and out of the fulness of my heart, do I often pour forth this or such like petitions, “Dearest <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    be for ever gracious to the houshold of ――!” My conscience hath smote me frequently, for not writing you a longer letter. I send this to ask pardon, and to assure you how often you and your daughters are upon my heart, when I go in and out before the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>—I long to hear how the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    hath magnified his strength in your weakness. It would fill a volume to tell his goodness and truth; and my base ingratitude sometimes comes with such conviction upon my heart, that I can scarce forbear getting off my horse, and humbling myself in the way side. Indeed, I am the chief of sinners, and yet overflowing hath the <span

    been in his love. You will hear more soon by the journal which will be sent. Dear <i><abbr

  <p class="vm_00">
    <i>Reverend and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH much pleasure (tho’ not till last week) I received your kind affectionate letter. I thank you for it with
    <a id="p140"></a>all my soul, and pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to reward you for this, and all other your works of faith and labours of love. You may depend on my not being prejudiced against you or your brethren, by any evil report. They only endear you to me more and more; and were your enemies to represent you as black as hell, I should think you were the more glorious in the sight of heaven. Your sweet criticisms and remarks upon my journal and sermons, were exceeding acceptable, and very just. I assure you, dear Sir, I am fully convinced of the doctrine of election, free justification, and final perseverance. My observations on the Quakers, were only intended for those particular persons with whom I then conversed. The tenets of the quakers in general, about <i>justification</i>, I take to be false and unscriptural. Your adversaries need take no advantage against you, by any thing I have written; for I think it every minister’s duty to declare against the corruptions of that church to which they belong, and not to look upon those as true members of their communion, who deny its publick constitutions. This is your case in <i>Scotland</i>, and ours in <i>England</i>. I see no other way for us to act at present, than to go on preaching the truth as it is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>;
    and then if our brethren cast us out, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will direct us to take that course which is most conducive to his glory, and his people’s good. I think I have but one objection against your proceedings; “Your insisting only on <i>presbyterian government</i>, exclusive of all other ways of worshipping <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    Will not this, <i>dear Sir</i>, necessarily lead you (whenever you get the upper-hand) to oppose and persecute all that differ from you in their church government, or outward way of worshipping <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    Our dear brother and fellow-labourer <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G―― T――</i>
    thinks this will be the consequence, and said he would write to you about it. As for my own part, (though I profess myself a minister of the church of <i>England</i>) I am of a <i>catholic spirit</i>; and if I see a man who loves the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    in sincerity, I am not very solicitous to what outward communion he belongs. The kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I think, does not consist in any such thing. These are my sentiments, dear Sir, and I write them out of love—I am ashamed (because only a babe in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>)
    to pretend as it were to direct; but true friendship needs no apology. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is doing great things in <i>America</i>. My journal,
    <a id="p141"></a>which I send over with this, will shew you what he has done already. Your welfare is much upon my heart, and as I am enabled, I make mention of you in my prayers. Affairs of the Orphan-house go on well. Some few, even <i>here</i>, love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    Oh, dear Sir, pray for us, and especially for</p>

    has done for your soul. May a double portion of his blessed spirit rest upon you; may our glorious ever-blessed <i>Emanuel</i> cause all his glory to pass before you, and may you be filled with all the fulness of <span

    Since my arrival here, I have received a sweet endearing instructive letter from <i><abbr

    I have answered it, and told him you promised to write about the necessity of a catholic spirit. <i><abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> C――</i>
    also has favoured me with a loving epistle. I have received and read his sermons since I saw you: they are acute and pointed, but I think not searching enough by many degrees—My dear brother, I love writers that go to the bottom—<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I hope to be with you at the synod—But what think you? I am sometimes doubting, whether I shall have sufficient matter given me to preach upon. Methinks I hear you say, “O thou of little faith! wherefore dost thou doubt? As thy day is, so shall thy strength be.” <i>Michael</i> and the dragon, I hear, are carrying on war most bravely in <i>England</i>. I really believe we shall not die, till we see the kingdom of <span

    come with power. The affairs of the orphan-house are in great forwardness. I have much to say; but time and business will not permit. Blessed be <span

    eternity is at hand, and then we shall have

  <p class="vm_00">
    <i>My dear Sister</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Rejoice to hear that you are enabled to see not only the freeness but eternal duration of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    grace. Till the sinner is convinced of this, I am persuaded he can neither work from a principle of true love, nor give <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    the honour due unto his name. He must always be making his salvation to depend <i>partly</i> at least on his own doings; “If I do so and so, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    will give me his grace:” But can any believer who knows himself, help confessing, that after he had received grace, he should have finally fallen from it, had the continuance of it depended on his own will? Indeed, my dear Sister, nothing so much comforts my own soul as the thought that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will never leave me nor forsake me; if he does, it must be for my unworthiness: But on that account it cannot be; for he never chose me on account of my unworthiness. He loved me freely, he prevented me by his grace; he chose me from eternity, he called me in time, and I am persuaded will keep me till time shall be no more.—This consideration makes my faith to work by love. Now, I can live not barely upon my frames, which notwithstanding are blessed things, but on the promises. Now, I can go on my way rejoicing, and, amidst all dejections, lift up my head in prospect of a certain and exceeding weight of glory. Though I fall, I know I shall rise again; for he that is brought truly to believe on <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    his faith shall never die. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    will not suffer to be lost the purchase of his blood. He knew for whom he died, and neither men nor devils shall ever pluck them out of his hands. Such as have been taught
    <a id="p146"></a>most of <span class="smcap">God</span>, I find, are thus minded. And I am persuaded were the effects of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    redemption to depend on a man’s own compliance, or was the continuance of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    grace to depend solely on man’s improvement, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    would have died in vain. <i>Adam</i> could not stand in paradise when left to his own free-will, how then can we? No, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    our salvation is put into better hands than our own. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    has purchased not only wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification, but also eternal redemption for us. Let this thought, my dear Sister, lift up our hands when they hang down, and strengthen our feeble knees; <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    gifts and callings are without repentance. There is no condemnation to them that are truly in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    And I write thus peremptorily to you, because I find now you are able to bear it.—Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    my dear Sister, flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you. I hope ere long our brethren will lay all carnal reasoning aside, and see and preach the truth in this respect, as it is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    My kindest love to your sister.—What I write to one, I write to both. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    direct your going in his way, and cause you to continue instant in prayer for</p>

    Some passages in your letter were dangerous to my soul. Whenever you see any growth of grace, pray that I may grow in humility in particular. Oh that I was lowly in heart!

    is getting himself the victory in the hearts of poor sinners. I hope many will now rejoice in his salvation. One good sign is, that he has employed the meanest, as well as vilest wretch, that he ever yet sent forth.—When I hear that any good is done by my unworthy hands, it almost makes me to blush.—Oh that I could humble myself in the dust, that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    alone may be exalted in his strength. I purpose to revisit <i>New-York</i> at the appointed time. You told me, “Our <span

    Dear Sir, help me to be thankful. Blessed be <span

    the Orphan-house affairs succeed well. Many souls will be redeemed by it from temporal, and I trust, from eternal bondage. I have taken in upwards of twenty children already, and I take in more daily.—I am building a large house, have many servants, and a good stock of cattle. It will cost much money.—But our <span

    the better we shall relish searching books. It is an evident sign of a false heart, when it is unwilling to be probed. Blessed be <span

    Nothing else can preserve you from idols; and you know when once the soul is off its watch, the devil makes sad ravages in it. There is nothing I dread more than having my heart drawn away by earthly objects.—When that time comes, it will be over with me indeed; I must then bid adieu to zeal and fervency of spirit, and in effect, bid the <span

    to depart from me. For alas, what room can there be for <span

    when a rival hath taken possession of the heart? Oh my dear Sister, pray that no such evil may befal me. My blood runs cold at the very thought thereof. I cannot, indeed; I cannot away with it. In a multiplicity of business, have I wrote you these lines. I thank you for your kind letter, and hope I shall always retain a grateful sense of the many favours I have received from your dear family. My kindest respects attend your sister; I long to hear of her being

    sanctify all his dispensations to us, and make us not only willing to be bound, but even to die for the sake of our dear Master. When I read how my letters, <abbr

  <p>
    I have not had much enlargement in preaching, since I have been here; but my heart is often weighed down, and torn to pieces with a sense of my desperately wicked and deceitful heart. I can subscribe to what you say, “Was <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

    Indeed, dear Sir, I travail as it were in birth, till <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    be thoroughly formed within you. If I do not forget my promise, I do not forget your favours.—I make mention of you in my prayers. Linger not, dear Sir, but haste out of your spiritual Sodom. Flee, flee to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    whose sacred blood has made an atonement for sinners. Lay hold on his everlasting righteousness, and chuse rather to suffer affliction with the people of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    than to enjoy any thing which this world may afford, for a season. Accept the sermons I have herewith sent, and believe me to be, <i>dear Sir</i>,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>ESTERDAY, after public worship, I received with pleasure your kind letter, and was immediately ready to cry out, Why do so many of my <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    servants take notice of such a dead dog as I am. Surely sovereign, rich, and free grace was never exalted more than in the mercy shewn to me, who am in truth the unworthiest of the sons of men.—<i>Honoured Sir</i>, it rejoices me to hear that there are so many at <i>New England</i>, who love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    in sincerity, and dare to shine as lights in the world amongst a crooked and perverse generation.—I wish they may be all <i>Aquila</i>’s and <i>Priscilla</i>’s to me, and teach me the way of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    more perfectly; for I long to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of my <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and Saviour <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Oh he is a sweet master; even here do I feel his blessed influences, and
    <a id="p155"></a>rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.—He is often with us in the midst of his sanctuary, and much succeeds the Orphan-house.—I have digged low, and intend to build it high, because I have a great <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to pay the charges. I have about thirty-six children which I maintain and cloath, and have upwards of forty persons more who are employed in the work. The plantation is in great forwardness.—Many families are kept here by my employing them, and I hope to see many a youth bred up for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    for I design to breed up for the ministry, all that at any time I shall perceive to be renewed by the Holy Ghost, and endued with suitable natural abilities. The work, I am persuaded, is of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and I know he will raise up instruments to support it. Let him chuse whom seemeth him good.—In about three months, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I hope to be near, or at <i>New England</i>. I thank you from my soul, honoured Sir, for your kind invitation; but, I believe, am pre-engaged to one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――d</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    reward both him, and all others who receive me in his name! I have not yet received the books, which you was pleased to send me, because they are sent to the southward, but I expect them daily, and doubt not of their being profitable. I know not how to express my gratitude for your great condescension in writing to me, but that I may always behave so as not to be ashamed of subscribing myself</p>

    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE I returned here, I received your letter and journal.—I thank you for both, and shall wait almost with impatience to see a continuance of your account of what <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is doing or has done amongst you—He knows my heart, I rejoice in whatever <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has done by your hands. I, præ, sequar, etsi non passibus equis.</p>
  <p>
    I could now send a particular answer to your last; but, my honoured friend and brother, for once hearken to a child, who is willing to wash your feet. I beseech you by the mercies of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>, if you would have my
    <a id="p156"></a>love confirmed towards you; write no more to me about misrepresentations wherein we differ. To the best of my knowledge at present, no sin has <i>dominion</i> over me, yet I feel the strugglings of indwelling sin day by day; I can therefore by no means come into your interpretation of the passage mentioned in the letter, and as explained in your preface to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Halyburton</i>—The
    doctrine of <i>election</i>, and the <i>final perseverance</i> of those that are truly in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    I am ten thousand times more convinced of, if possible, than when I saw you last—You think otherwise: why then should we dispute, when there is no probability of convincing? Will it not in the end destroy brotherly love, and insensibly take from us that cordial union and sweetness of soul, which I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may always subsist between us? How glad would the enemies of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    be to see us divided? How many would rejoice, should I join and make a party against you? And in one word, how would the cause of our common master every way suffer by our raising disputes about particular points of doctrines? <i>Honoured Sir</i>, let us offer salvation freely to all by the blood of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>; and whatever light <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has communicated to us, let us freely communicate to others. I have lately read the life of <i>Luther</i>, and think it in no wise to his honour, that the last part of his life was so much taken up in disputing with <i>Zuinglius</i> and others; who in all probability equally loved the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    notwithstanding they might differ from him in other points. Let this, dear Sir, be a caution to us, I hope it will to me; for by the blessing of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    provoke me to it as much as you please, I do not think ever to enter the lists of controversy with you on the points wherein we differ. Only I pray to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that the more you <i>judge me</i>, the more I may <i>love you</i>, and learn to desire no ones approbation, but that of my <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and master <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.—Ere
    this reaches you, I suppose you will hear of my late excursion to <i>Charles Town</i>. A great work I believe is begun there. Enclosed I have sent you <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Garden’s letters</i>—They
    will serve to convince you, more and more, of the necessity you lie under to be instant in season and out of season. Oh, dear honoured Sir, I wish you as much success as your own heart can wish. Was you here, I would weep over you with tears of love, and tell you what great things <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath done for my soul, since we parted
    <a id="p157"></a>last. Indeed and indeed, I often and heartily pray for your success in the gospel: May your inward strength and outward sphere increase day by day! May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    use you as a choice and singular instrument of promoting his glory on earth, and may I see you crowned with an eternal and exceeding weight of glory in the world to come! This is the hearty desire of, honoured Sir,</p>

    His letter lies by me, and I now am inclined to answer it. My dear brother, how do you feel your heart? Is it grown sick of original and actual sin? Is it grown sick of unbelief and self-righteousness? Is it closely united to the holy <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>?
    Do you feed on him in your heart by faith? And do you receive of his fulness day by day? I ask these questions, because I want to see you write of the inward life, and to hear you talk of your having a feeling possession of your <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    For he that believeth aright, hath the witness within himself. How do the brethren? I hope there is no more saying “I am of <i>Paul</i>,” or “I am of <i>Apollos</i>,” but that you are only desirous of being one in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I pray for, though distant from you. I believe I am preparing a place for many. Our work goes on bravely. I have near forty little ones now in my house. Some of them I trust will be effectually wrought upon, and made christians indeed. We all live in love and unity, and most I hope are seeking after <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    He is pleased from time to time to manifest himself to my soul, and to shew me how unworthy I am of the least mercy. Shortly I shall go northward, to preach the gospel and collect fresh contributions for my orphans. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has given me an earnest of what he will do in <i>America</i>, by the large collection that was made at <i>Charles Town</i>—I live every day in expectation of hearing from my <i>London</i> friends. My brother, the captain, refreshed my soul with glad tidings and letters from <i>Bristol</i>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gave me great comfort and satisfaction

    opportunity—Our brethren I trust go forwards in the spiritual life. I have often great inward trials—Pray that I may be kept in all changes, and seeming chances of this mortal life. I believe it to be <span

    <i>My dear friends</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE I wrote last, we have buried our Sister <i>L――</i>. <i>Rachel</i> I left at <i>Philadelphia</i>, and sister <i>T――</i> seems to be in a declining state; so that sister <i>A――</i> alone is like to be left of all the women which came over with me from <i>England</i>. I find by experience, that a mistress is absolutely necessary for the due management of my increasing family, and to take off some of that care, which at present lies upon me. Besides, I shall in all probability, at my next return from <i>England</i>, bring more women with me: and I find, unless they are all truly gracious (or indeed if they are) without a superior, matters cannot be carried on as becometh the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    It hath been therefore much impressed upon my heart, that I should marry, in order to have a help meet for me in the work whereunto our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    hath called me. This comes (like <i>Abraham</i>’s servant to <i>Rebekah</i>’s relations) to know whether you think your daughter, <i>Miss E――</i>, is a proper person to engage in such an undertaking? If so; whether you will be pleased to give me leave to propose marriage unto her? You need not be afraid of sending me a refusal. For, I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    if I know any thing of my own heart, I am free from that foolish passion, which the world calls <span
      class="smcap">Love</span>.
    I write, only because I believe it is the will of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that I should alter my state; but your denial will fully convince me, that your daughter is not the person appointed by <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for me. He knows my heart; I would not marry but for him, and in him, for ten thousand worlds.—But I have sometimes thought <i>Miss E――</i> would be my help-mate; for she has often been impressed upon my heart. I should think myself safer in your family, because so many of you love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    and consequently would be more watchful over my precious and immortal soul. After strong crying and tears at the throne of grace for direction, and after unspeakable troubles with my own heart, I write this.
    <a id="p160"></a>Be pleased to spread the letter before the <span

    <span class="dropcap">B</span>E not surprised at the contents of this:—The letter sent to your honoured father and mother will acquaint you with the reasons. Do you think, you could undergo the fatigues, that must necessarily attend being joined to one, who is every day liable to be called out to suffer for the sake of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>?
    Can you bear to leave your father and kindred’s house, and to trust on him, (who feedeth the young ravens that call upon him) for your own and childrens support, supposing it should please him to bless you with any? Can you undertake to help a husband in the charge of a family, consisting perhaps of a hundred persons? Can you bear the inclemencies of the air both as to cold and heat in a foreign climate? Can you, when you have an husband, be as though you had none, and willingly part with him, even for a long season, when his <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    and master shall call him forth to preach the gospel, and command him to leave you behind? If after seeking to <span

    for direction, and searching your heart, you can say, “I can do all those things through <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>

      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and you came with me at my return from <i>England</i>, to be a help meet for me in the management of the orphan-house? I have great reason to believe it is the divine will that I should alter my condition, and have often thought you was the person appointed for me. I shall still wait on <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for direction, and heartily intreat him, that if this motion be not of him, it may come to nought.—I write thus plainly, because, I trust, I write not from any other principles but the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.—I
    shall make it my business to call on the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    and would advise you to consult both him
    <a id="p161"></a>and your friends—For in order to attain a blessing, we should call both the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    and his disciples to the marriage—I much like the manner of <i>Isaac</i>’s marrying with <i>Rebekah</i>, and think no marriage can succeed well, unless both parties concerned are like-minded with <i>Tobias</i> and his wife—I think I can call the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Isaac</i> and <i>Jacob</i>, to witness that I desire “to take you my sister to wife, not for lust, but uprightly;” and therefore I hope he will mercifully ordain, if it be his blessed will we should be joined together, that we may walk as <i>Zachary</i> and <i>Elizabeth</i> did, in all the ordinances of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    blameless. I make no great profession to you, because I believe you think me sincere. The passionate expressions which carnal courtiers use, I think, ought to be avoided by those that would marry in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I can only promise, by the help of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    “to keep my matrimonial vow, and to do what I can towards helping you forward in the great work of your salvation.” If you think marriage will be any way prejudicial to your better part, be so kind as to send me a denial. I would not be a snare to you for the world. You need not be afraid of speaking your mind. I trust, I love you only for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and desire to be joined to you only by his command, and for his sake. With fear and much trembling I write, and shall patiently tarry the <span

    <i>My dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU, as well as your dear associates, are much upon my heart. I long to hear that you are advanced in grace, and grown in the knowledge of <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> your <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I say <i>your Lord</i>; for I hope, ere now, you can appropriate <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    to yourself, and, without the least diffidence or doubt, cry out assuredly, “My <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    When the soul says this, <i>then</i>, but not till then, is it truly married to the dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>;
    then are we true children of the bridegroom, and are real partakers of the supper of the Lamb. This, this is faith: this is believing; not with the head; not in notion only; but with the heart, indeed and in truth. The soul now puts its <i>amen</i>, and sets the seal to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    everlasting promises; it now soars upwards towards heavenly things, and feels continually the invisible realities of another world. Though sometimes overshadowed by a cloud, yet still it knows that its Redeemer liveth, and justifieth the ungodly. It cannot doubt of his favour, though sometimes he is pleased to withdraw his sensible presence. The root of the matter is twisted round every faculty of the soul, which daily is supported with this assurance, that <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    can no more forsake the soul he loves, than he can forsake himself. Oh my dear brother,
    <a id="p163"></a>I find myself much carried out to write of that divine life, that divine mystery of godliness, the hidden kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in the heart. If any thing I can say, or do, or write, may be any way serviceable to dear <abbr

    it will much rejoice</p>

    May the Holy Ghost come upon him, and the power of the Highest overshadow him; and may our glorious Redeemer never cease striving with him, till he hath a witness within himself that he is a true child of <span

    May I hear that you have recovered your first love, and are, as formerly, zealous of good works! I think I never yet really doubted of your return. If prayers to <span

    if entreaties to him, can bring my dear friend back, he shall not be led away captive by the world; he shall, he shall be a Christian indeed. I long to see you, and till then shall wrestle with strong cryings and many tears with my dear <span

    in your behalf. I feel, I feel <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    love; I can no more doubt of my interest in him, than I can of the shining of the sun at noon day. He fills, he sweetens and gladdens my soul; he loves me freely: he will bring me to behold his glory. I think I could now bid to men and devils defiance. Who is he that condemneth? It is <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    that justifies, who even now sitteth in heaven to make intercession <i>for me</i>. You see, my dear friend, I am upon the mount. I know not how to stop. It is true, I must come down; but it is only that I may go up again, and take a view of the heavenly <i>Canaan</i>. I am now near the port whither we are bound:
    <a id="p164"></a>yet a little while, and I shall be in heaven; and shall I not meet my dear <i>I――</i> there? <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    forbid! No, no; I cannot bear the thought of it. Away, my dear, dear brother, to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Lay hold on his everlasting righteousness: look, look unto him by faith, and be saved. Call your dear wife to look also. Help, oh help her in the great work of her salvation; and breed up your dear child in the nurture and admonition of the <span

    <i>My Dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have been a few days returned from <i>Charles-Town</i>, where our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    I trust, has begun a glorious work. Many came to me under convictions, and were made to cry out, “What shall we do to be saved?” The people were exceeding desirous of my return amongst them. If I call there, as I come northward, it may prevent my being at <i>New-York</i> so soon as was proposed. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    direct my going in his way. A <i>Fosterian Preacher</i> lost ground there. I think you are not much to be blamed for going out of church; but perhaps it might be better, on another such occasion, to hear the whole discourse, and then go and converse with the preacher upon it; otherwise a man may say, you are angry, and could not judge, because you did not hear all. Praise is more dangerous than contempt: but when our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    honour can be promoted by the display of our graces, we need not fear. His grace will be sufficient for us. I know not what person it is that you would not have me be so open to, unless it be <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――.
    I had rather be too open than too reserved. Simplicity much becomes the <i>Israel</i> of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    A few days past, with full assurance of faith, I laid the first brick of our great house: <i>Jeremiah</i> bought land when the people were leading into captivity. My family daily increase, and, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    as yet I am kept from doubting. Pray that my faith may never fail. Some of
    <a id="p165"></a>the <i>Germans</i> in <i>America</i> are holy souls, and deserve the character they bear. They keep up a close walk with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and are remarkable for their sweetness and simplicity of behaviour. They talk little, and think much. Most of them, I believe, are <i>Lutherans</i>. But where there is the image of my dear Master, there are my affections drawn. This is the catholic spirit you breathe after: the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I am persuaded, will give it to your soul. All that people do say of me, affects me but little; because I know worse of myself than they can say concerning me. My heart is desperately wicked. Was <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to leave me, I should be a remarkable sinner. But redeeming love, I believe, will not let us go. Oh! dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>N.</i>
    pray, and give thanks for me. I daily taste that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is gracious. All things go on well. My dear brethren salute you, as does</p>

    <span class="dropcap">R</span>EAD where I am, and judge whether or not I am a stranger and pilgrim upon earth. Yesterday, after a short passage of ten days, did <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    bring us from <i>Georgia</i> to <i>New-Castle</i>: there I preached twice. To-day I shall preach here, and in the evening hope to reach <i>Philadelphia</i>. People are much alarmed already; and great things, I find, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been pleased to do, by what he enabled me to deliver when last here. Two ministers have been convinced of their formal state, notwithstanding they held and preached the doctrines of grace. One plainly told the congregation he had been deceiving himself and them, and could not preach any more, but desired the people to pray with him. Another is as a flame of fire, and hath been much owned of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    An opposer reading my sermon, in order to convince them I did not preach as <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>,
    was much disappointed; for power went along with the sermon, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    spirit fell on the people, and formal opposers went affrighted away. It is unknown what a glorious stir here is in the province. Many, very many, I believe,
    <a id="p166"></a>of late have been brought savingly to believe on the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    The work much increases, and here is employment for many months: but I must return shortly to <i>Savannah</i>. A primitive spirit revives; and many, I hope, will be brought to live stedfast in the apostles doctrine, in fellowship, and breaking of bread, and in prayer. Perhaps dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    may be one of them. Pray how does that young man do? Is he deeply humbled, and closely united to the dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>?
    Does he feel himself a poor sinner, and daily experience the outgoing and incoming of the blessed spirit in the sanctuary of his heart? Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I do: even whilst I am writing I feel his power. I am persuaded I shall be more than conqueror over every evil, through my Redeemer’s love. Oh! my dear friend, keep close to the dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>!
    Do not go without his leading, and then you are safe, though in the midst of devils. Adieu.</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">B</span>LESSED be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I can send you glad tidings of great joy. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    is getting himself the victory in these parts. The Orphan-house affairs go forward beyond expectation. I have upwards of <i>forty children</i> in my house at <i>Savannah</i>, near <i>seventy persons</i> in family, and upwards of an <i>hundred people</i> to provide for every day. As yet we want for nothing. The great housholder of mankind gives us all things richly to enjoy, and, I am persuaded, will provide for us whilst we trust in him. I had rather live by faith, and depend on <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for the support of my great, and yet increasing family, than to have the largest visible fund in the universe. About five weeks ago the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    stirred up the <i>Charles-Town</i> people to contribute upwards of seventy pounds sterling towards the support of my little ones. A glorious work was also begun in the hearts of the inhabitants; and many were brought to cry out, “What shall we do to be saved?” A fortnight ago, after a short passage of ten days, I landed in <i>Pensylvania</i>, and have had the pleasure of seeing and hearing, that my poor endeavours for promoting <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    kingdom, when there last, were not altogether vain in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I cannot well tell you how many have come unto me, labouring under the deepest convictions, and seemingly desirous of finding rest in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Several have, I humbly hope, actually received him into their hearts by faith, and have not only righteousness and peace, but also joy in the Holy Ghost. In short, the word hath run and been much glorified; and many <i>Negroes</i> also are in a fair way of being brought home to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I daily receive fresh and most importunate invitations to preach in all the adjacent countries. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is pleased to give a great blessing to my printed Sermons: they are now in the hands of thousands in these parts, and are a means, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    of enlightening and building up many in their most holy faith. Since such an effectual door is opened for preaching the everlasting gospel, you will not be surprized if I acquaint you there are many adversaries. The <i>Clergy</i>, I find, are greatly offended at me. The
    <a id="p168"></a>commissary of <i>Philadelphia</i>, having got a little stronger party than when I was there last, has thrown off the mask, denied me the pulpit, and last <i>Sunday</i> preached up an <i>historical faith</i>, and <i>justification by works</i>. But people only flock the more to me. The power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is more visible than ever in our assemblies; and more than ever before are convinced that I preach the doctrine of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Some few bigotted self-righteous <i>Quakers</i> also, now begin to spit out a little of the serpent: they cannot bear the doctrine of <i>original sin</i>, or of <i>imputed righteousness</i> as the cause of our acceptance with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    One calls original sin “original nonsense;” and several have been to me, under the apprehension of being thrust out, for owning and confessing what I take to be the truth as it is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has now brought me to <i>New Brunswick</i>, where I am blessed with the conversation of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G―― T――</i>.
    Indeed he is a good soldier of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is pleased in a wonderful manner to own both him and his brethren. The congregations where they have preached have been surprizingly convicted and melted down. They are unwearied in doing good, and go out into the highways and hedges to compel poor sinners to come in. Yesterday also I heard of two ministers in <i>Long Island</i>, near <i>New-York</i>, who had large communications from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and have been instrumental in bringing many souls to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I could add more; but I must away: the people are waiting for a spiritual meal. They fly to the doctrine as doves to the windows, and I trust the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is now reviving his work in the midst of the years. With great difficulty I have redeemed time to send you these few lines. I hope you and the rest of my dear friends continue to pray for me: for I believe never was so weak a wretch sent on such an important errand. But when I am weak, then am I strong. My bodily strength, by frequent journeying and continued speaking, sometimes fails me; but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    quickens and strengthens me by his mighty power. The more I am opposed, the more joy I feel; and the first fruits of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    spirit, which he hath imparted to my soul, are so sweet, that I almost with impatience wait till I reap a full harvest in the fruition of my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Continue, I beseech you, to intercede
    <a id="p169"></a>for me; and rest satisfied that both you and my other <i>English</i> friends are always remembered by</p>

    the devil’s children begin to throw off the mask. I want to draw the lingering battle on. At <i>Philadelphia</i> affairs go on better and better; only Satan now begins to throw many into fits. I have generally preached twice and rode near thirty miles a-day since you left me. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath been my support, and has often so melted me with a sense of his free, sovereign, and everlasting love, that some thought I was giving up the ghost. Oh never let go your sense of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    sovereign, everlasting love! It is food to my poor soul. Was it not for that, surely I must sink
    <a id="p170"></a>under the prospect of the labours and sufferings that are before me. My dear brother, What is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>

      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Be sure you keep a close walk with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.—Be
    much in prayer, and prepare for the greatest hardships. Your greatest perils will be amongst your own countrymen. The heathens will be stirred up by them, as the Gentiles were
    <a id="p171"></a>by the Jews; but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    will make you more than conqueror over all. The word of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> will make its own way. Beg of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to give you true notions of our free justification by faith in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Bring your <i>Indian</i> hearers to believe, before you talk of baptism, or the supper of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Otherwise they will catch at a shadow, and neglect the substance. Improve the leisure you now enjoy, and see that you feel the truths you speak. Feed on this promise, “It shall be given you in that hour what you shall say.” Your circumstances call for a fulfilling of it—Tell them what <span
      class="smcap">God</span> has been doing here, and how happy <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    will make them. Be sure tell them, tell them, that true faith is not merely in the head, but in the heart, and that it will certainly be productive of good works. Frequently meditate on <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    free love to yourself, and that will best qualify you to speak of it affectionately to others. I could say more, but time will not permit. Pray for me. All with me salute you. My poor petitions you may depend on, as the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    shall enable me. My love to all, and believe me to be</p>

    <i>To the Allegany Indians.</i></p>
  <p class="align_rt padr_10 secthdbrk">
    <i>Reedy Island, May 21, 1740.</i></p>
  <p class="vm_00">
    <i>My Dear Brethren</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">F</span>OR so I call you, because you, and I, and all, have one common father, <span
      class="smcap">One God</span>,
    in whom we live, move and have our beings. We all came at first out of the dust of the earth. For after <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    made the sun, moon, stars, and every thing you see, he also made a creature called <i>man</i>, and breathed into him the breath of life; he then became a living soul. He could not only walk and speak, but he could also think, and reason, and was full of goodness, peace, and joy. This man, this happy creature <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    placed in a garden, which his own right hand had planted. He then cast him into a deep sleep, and out of one of his ribs made what we call a woman, that she might be his wife. Their names were <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i>. With these, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    made an agreement that they should
    <a id="p172"></a>eat of every tree of that garden, except one; but if they ate the fruit of that particular tree, they should die; they should return to the dust from whence they were taken, lose the comforts they enjoyed in their souls, and be unhappy for ever in another world. But if they did not eat this fruit, none of these things should come upon them. A being, which we call the <i>devil</i>, (and who for his pride had been cast out of heaven) envying their happiness, tempted them to eat the forbidden fruit. They consented, they ate, they died. Their bodies became mortal, their souls were deprived of the presence and love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    and unless a way was found out to make satisfaction for what they had done, they must have been lost for ever. These were our parents, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    made this agreement with us their children, as well as with them. For they acted in our name, as a king acts in the name of his people, or a father in the name of a child—What therefore befel them, befel us. We died in them; and come into this world poor and miserable, blind and naked, as they were, when they had eaten of the forbidden tree. Hence it is, that we are given to lust, anger, envy, hatred, pride, and malice, and all those troublesome passions which you all must feel in your own hearts, and cannot but see even in the hearts of your children. If then, you only look into yourselves, you must confess these things are so. But <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath given us a <i>book</i>, wherein he assures us of the truth of all this:—And we know that book came from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, because none but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    could tell us the things therein contained. And I speak first of this, because ’till you feel and believe this, you cannot come to the knowledge of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>;
    and without the knowledge of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    you cannot be saved. For after our first parents, <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i>, had taken the forbidden fruit, and with all their children, thereafter to be born, became guilty before <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    out of his own free love sent his only begotten Son into the world, to die, and so to make an atonement for the sin of fallen man, and also to obey the law, which man had broken; so that though fallen man had no righteousness of his own, yet upon believing in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    Son, he should find a perfect righteousness in him. This Son is called <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    “A Saviour,” because he was to save us from
    <a id="p173"></a>the guilt and power of our sins. He was truly <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and therefore could satisfy; he was truly man, and therefore could obey and suffer in our stead. He was <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and man in one person, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and man might be happy together again. My dear brethren, (for so I must call you, though I never saw you) these are strange things. But if you are willing to learn, the holy spirit shall teach you. For <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> by dying, and obeying <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    law, hath bought for us the holy spirit, who shall change your corrupt natures, and fit you for happiness hereafter with the ever-blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    if you do but believe in your hearts.—Thousands of white people only believe in their heads, and therefore are no more christians than those who never heard of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> at all. They call <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    “Lord, Lord,” but they do not live as <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    hath commanded. No, they curse and swear, they break the sabbath, they get drunk, they play, they whore, they commit adultery, and have taught many poor <i>Indians</i> to do these abominable things as well as themselves. Do not you therefore learn of them. For true christians are sober, chaste and holy. They will not get drunk, they will not play the whore, they will not cheat, lie, curse or swear; but they will bless and praise <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    keep the sabbath, and do all the good they can; for thus <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, their <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    and master, lived when he was here on earth. I say, when he was here on earth; for after he died, he rose again, and went up into heaven from whence he came, and there he sits praying for all that shall believe on Him to the end of the world. For as the world had a beginning, so it also will have an end. And <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    will come again in the clouds to judge all mankind; and then he that hath believed in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and hath shewn forth his faith by his works, shall be saved; and he that hath not believed in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    shall be damned for ever, and be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone. But before he comes, he hath promised that the heathen shall be brought to believe on him, and therefore I write this letter to you. I would come myself, and preach the glad tidings of salvation among you, as the bearer of this could interpret for me; but my other business will not permit. I am a minister of the same <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and once was as ignorant of Him comparatively as you may be. I once lived like other people;
    <a id="p174"></a>but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    hath brought me to believe on Him, and I now do so no more. I once was full of envy, hatred, malice, and such like cursed tempers; but now I have love, and peace, and joy. And because <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    hath shewn such mercy to me, I desire that all others should be made as happy, nay happier than I am myself.—Hearken therefore now to the voice of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>. Pray to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that you may feel yourselves poor, miserable sinners, and come by a living faith to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Then he will pardon you of all your sins, make you holy by his spirit here, and take you into everlasting happiness hereafter. Your traders, some of them at least, will tell you, that you must be miserable, if you will be christians. But these know nothing of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>;
    for they are ungodly men, walking after their own wicked lusts. Whosoever will follow <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    though happy in himself, must be looked upon as a fool by others. The spirit of the world, and the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    are quite contrary one to the other; and therefore if you will live godly in Him, you must suffer persecution; you must have all manner of evil spoken against you falsely, and be called madmen and fools; but let not that daunt you, or make you afraid. There is a world to come, there is a judgment-day, and then <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    shall crown all those with glory, who have suffered for his name’s sake. Once more, therefore, hearken to the voice of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>. For the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    died for you, as well as for the white men among you, and that you might be taught the gospel; but they have made you worse than you were before, and therefore shall receive the greater damnation. He who brings this, no doubt, will be despised amongst them, because he will, I hope, neither get drunk, nor curse, nor swear.—But I trust the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will strengthen him, and cause him to shew many of you the true way of salvation—I shall not fail to pray for him, and for you; for though I know you not, yet if I could thereby save your precious souls, I think I could die for your sake. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    bless you, and bring you out of darkness into his marvellous light, for his infinite mercy’s sake. This is the prayer of, dear brethren,</p>

    is love, and never corrects us but for our own good. I find it is always thus with me. I am a stubborn, ungrateful, disobedient child, and often oblige him to strike me severely; but love, I find, holds the rod, and therefore his rod, as well as his staff comforts me. Farewel; the <span

    <i>Whitefield</i> went on board at <i>New-Castle</i>, in order to sail to <i>Georgia</i>, after having been on shore thirty-three days, and travelled some hundreds of miles, and preached fifty-eight times in the provinces of <i>New-Jersey</i>, <i>New-York</i>, and <i>Pensylvania</i>.—His congregations consisted sometimes of four, sometimes of five, sometimes of eight, twelve, fifteen, and once at <i>Philadelphia</i>, of <i>twenty thousand</i> people. He had gotten near five hundred pounds sterling, in money and provisions, for the Orphan-house at <i>Georgia</i>. Great and visible effects followed his preaching, almost wheresoever he went, especially in <i>Philadelphia</i>. There was never such a general awakening, and concern for the things of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    known in <i>America</i> before. He intended to visit <i>New-England</i> soon after his arrival at <i>Georgia</i>, and to come by land as far as <i>Philadelphia</i>, at the latter end of the year.”</p>

    is with me of a truth. Several ships are lying by us, and the captains and their companies come to our ship to prayers. Sailors weep: It is unknown how many are under conviction.

I hope there is a door opening among the <i>Allegany</i> Indians. I have read <i>M――</i>’s journal, and have wrote both to him and them. We have been near a week at <i>Reedy Island</i>: I have preached there five times. The captains and their crews come constantly to public worship on shore, and to private prayer in our sloop. We have some with us that love our dear <span

    <span class="dropcap">M</span>Y will is much to go to <i>Georgia</i>, but my dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    is pleased to cross me. For ever blessed be his great and glorious name. Just now the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath brought me hither. Your letter pleased me. I hope our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is now beginning to answer my prayers, and that my dear Brother <i>S――</i> is about to know himself. You know I have often told you, that you ought to suspect your experiences. You have mistaken, in my opinion, <i>preparation</i>, for conversion itself. Your nine years round of duties, were no effects of the new-birth at all. How could they be? when you did not know you was to be born again, before you heard <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C―― W――</i>
    expound the seventh chapter of the <i>Romans</i>: Then, but not till then did you begin to be enlightened, and illumination and conversion are two different things. All my great
    <a id="p181"></a>trials were consequent on this. Not that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    way of dealing with me, ought to be a rule for others: But I think your case and mine somewhat parallel.—Those that have been most humbled, I find, always make the most solid, useful christians. It stands with reason: The more a man is emptied of himself, the more room is there made for the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to dwell in him.—Your caution to dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H.</i>
    was very good. Openness is the best preservative of spiritual friendship. I would behave so, that no one might be afraid to consult me; but if people will not open their hearts, let them not blame me; I cannot speak, where I perceive a shyness, and where I see persons are afraid of me. I am sure they must harbour some ungenerous suspicions or other against me, and how then can there be a harmony of soul. My dear brother, my friend, now I have told you my heart: Be not angry, I am just ready to weep.—Indeed, I am willing to wash your feet, and to acknowledge all favours under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that I have received from you. Be stable, be willing to consult others that have trod in the spiritual road before you; do not mistake working <i>for</i> life, for <i>working from life</i>. Watch unto prayer, and do not be carried away by every wind of doctrine. How could you not see through <i>L――</i> of <i>German-Town</i>? But I must not chide, but love. Much I owe you; have patience with me and I will endeavour to pay you. I shall long to see you at <i>Savannah</i>. Once more, my dear friend and brother, adieu. My heart is much melted down. <span

    <a id="p182"></a>I differ from your notion about not committing sin, and your denying the doctrines of election, and final perseverance of the saints. I dread coming to <i>England</i>, unless you are resolved to oppose these truths with less warmth, than when I was there last. I dread your coming over to <i>America</i>; because the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is carried on here (and that in a most glorious manner) by doctrines quite opposite to those you hold. Here are thousands of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    children, who will not be persuaded out of the privileges purchased for them by the blood of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    Here are many worthy experienced ministers, who would oppose your principles to the utmost. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    direct me what to do! Sometimes I think it best to stay here, where we all think and speak the same thing: The work goes on without divisions, and with more success, because all employed in it are of one mind. I write not this, <i>honoured Sir</i>, from heat of spirit, but out of love. At present, I think you are entirely inconsistent with yourself, and therefore do not blame me, if I do not approve of all that you say. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    himself, I find, teaches my friends the doctrine of election. Sister <i>H――</i> hath lately been convinced of it; and, if I mistake not, dear and honoured <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    hereafter will be convinced also. From my soul I wish you abundant success in the name of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I long to hear of your being made a spiritual father to thousands. Perhaps I may never see you again, ’till we meet in judgment; then, if not before, you will know, that sovereign, distinguishing, irresistible grace brought you to heaven. Then will you know, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    loved you with an everlasting love, and therefore with loving-kindness did he draw you. Honoured Sir, farewel. My prayers constantly attend both you and your labours. I neglect no opportunity of writing. My next journal will acquaint you with new and surprizing wonders. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    fills me both in body and soul. I am supported under the prospect of present and impending trials, with an assurance of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    loving me to the end; yea, even to all eternity. Ere this reaches you, I suppose you will hear of my intention to marry. I am quite as free as a child: If it be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    will, I beseech him to prevent it. I would not be hindered in my dear <span

    business for the world. I am now waiting for a fair wind. <span

    <span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE I knew you by name, my heart was uncommonly affected towards you. Whenever I saw you at church, I enquired concerning you, and to my great but pleasing surprize, when I came to your house, found you was the man I was enquiring after. Your letter gives me still hopes, that our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    is about to awaken you from a carnal security in which you have long lain. He is now calling you, dear, dear Sir. I beseech you, by the mercies of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>
    our Saviour, take heed that you do not lie down again. If you will be a follower of the Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    you must prepare your soul for manifold temptations; you must become the song of the drunkard, and have all manner of evil spoken against you falsely for <span

    sake: But let none of these things move you, dear Sir. Dare, I beseech you, to be singularly good.—Be not ashamed of your glory.—Learn a lesson of boldness even from the devil’s children. How resolute, how daring are they in their master’s cause? Why should not we be equally courageous in the cause of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>?
    O Sir, I feel a concern for the welfare of your better part. <span

    hath vouchsafed you some convictions; do not rest in them. Catch not too greedily at comfort. Beg of <span

    that you may be thoroughly wounded, before you desire to be made whole; otherwise you will go but half way, and be only an unstable, double-minded man at last. <span

    <i>My dear, dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH great comfort I received your long wished-for letter. It warmed my heart, and knit my soul to you much more than ever. Whenever I see the child-like simplicity and love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    it quite melts me down. Let all former misunderstandings between me and your friends be entirely forgotten. I always pitied your parents, and most earnestly prayed for them and you. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that you are come home. You are now, I believe, as I always did believe, in your proper station. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give you a settled habit of devotion, and so fill you with his spirit, that whilst you are working for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    on earth, you may be like those blessed angels, who, though ministring to us, yet do always behold the face of our Father who is in heaven. My dear brother, let the love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    constrain you to love him with all your soul. A sense of his divine love now melts down my heart, and draws tears from my eyes. O what wonderful things is <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    doing in <i>America</i>! <i>Savannah</i> also, <i>my dear Savannah</i>, especially my little orphans, now begin to feel the love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I arrived here but about two days ago, in an hour quite unexpected by my friends. How did we weep over one another for joy! Perhaps I may never feel the like again, till I meet with the sons of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in glory: But oh what a scene was to be seen last night in the congregation! How did the stately steps of our glorious Emmanuel appear! His glory shone with exceeding brightness. The power seemed to be coming on all the day. My soul has been much carried out in behalf of this place, and now the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is about to answer my prayer. <i>T―― D――</i> was yesterday in a glorious agony. I prayed with three of the girls before I went to church, and their hearts were ready to break: I prayed also, with strong cryings and tears, with my other dear friends, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was much with us then; but when we came to church, oh what was to be seen, and heard, and felt there! The power of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    came as it were upon all. Most of
    <a id="p185"></a>the children, both boys and girls, cried bitterly, and most of the congregation were drowned in tears, and mourned as a woman mourneth for her first-born. Expence of spirits made my body weak, but my soul still wrestled earnestly with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    When I came home, I lay upon my bed; but seeing the children and people come home crying, I went to prayer again, and a greater power than ever still attended it. O how was my soul carried out, and how did the Holy Ghost fill the room! At last I thought proper to dismiss them; but it would have charmed your heart to hear the little ones in different parts of the house praying, and begging of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to take full possession of their hearts. The same power continues to-day: For near two hours, four or five of the girls have been before the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    weeping most bitterly, and under such agonies, as gives me hope our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will soon send them deliverance. I have not yet talked with the boys, who also have been under great concern, and one especially in great agonies. I believe two or three will be truly gracious. I have brought with me a Latin master, and on <i>Monday</i> laid a foundation in the name of our dear <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    for an <i>university</i> in <i>Georgia</i>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    blesses me (O free and sovereign grace) in every thing I undertake. Our Orphan-house comes under better regulations every day, and I am persuaded, in the end, will produce some true followers of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I am now looking for fresh attacks from the enemy, after such inroads. He has been busy since my departure, but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath vouchsafed to rebuke and disappoint him. My dear brother, may the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> be with you! For <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake desire dear Brother <i>W――</i>
    to avoid disputing with me. I think I had rather die, than to see a division between us; and yet, how can we walk together, if we oppose each other? Adieu. Dear <i>James</i>, with much tenderness I subscribe myself</p>

    <i>Reverend and dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have just been reading the three letters you sent some time ago to our dear brother <i>N――</i>, and find my heart much inclined to write you a line. Whatever others may do, yet I am far from judging you on account of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    dealings with your soul. I rather rejoice in them, having myself been blessed with many experiences of the like nature. But, my dear brother, if <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    works upon us in an extraordinary manner, we must prepare for temptation, even from our christian brethren.</p>
  <p>
    Most judge of others from what has passed within themselves; and many of the dear children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> are too apt to confine <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to this or that particular way of acting; whereas he is a sovereign agent: his sacred spirit bloweth when, and where, and how it listeth; and when an uncommon work is to be done, no doubt he will work upon his chosen instruments in an uncommon manner. What the event of the present general awakening will be, I know not. I desire to follow my dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    blindfold, whithersoever he is pleased to lead me; and to do just so much, and no more, as his providence points out to me. Wonderful things have been done ever since my arrival at <i>Savannah</i>: Such an awakening among little children, I never saw before. Our dear brother <i>N――</i>’s letter will acquaint you with particulars. O my dear brother, how ought such manifestations of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    glory, to quicken our souls, and excite us to lay out ourselves more and more in the service of the best of Masters, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>!
    Every day he fills me with himself, and sometimes brings me even upon the confines of eternity. Methinks I often stand upon <i>Mount Pisgah</i>, and take a view of the heavenly <i>Canaan</i>, and then long to be gathered to my people: but, my dear brother, both you and I must suffer, and that great things, before we enter into glory. My work is scarce begun; my trials are yet to come. What is a little scourge of the tongue? What is a thrusting out of the synagogues? The time of temptation will be, when we are thrust into an inner
    <a id="p189"></a>prison, and feel the iron entering even into our souls. Then, perhaps, even <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people may be permitted to forsake us for a while, and none but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    to stand by us. “But if thou, O dearest Redeemer! wilt strengthen me in the inner man, let enemies plunge me into a fiery furnace, or throw me into a den of lions.” My dear brother, my heart is enlarged towards you: though I never saw, yet I love you most tenderly. How does dear brother <i>D――</i>? Does he yet walk in the light of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    countenance? Pray salute him lovingly in my name. In the fall, I hope to see you in <i>Long Island</i>, and to be somewhat filled with your company. In the mean while, let us all keep a close walk with <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>;
    and be pleased, in an especial manner, to remember</p>
  <p class="blk_90 align_ctr">

      class="smcap">God</span>
    has done for your soul. I am glad to hear that you speak up for an attendance on the means of grace, and do not encourage persons who run (I am persuaded) before they are called. The work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will suffer much by such imprudence. I trust you will
    <a id="p190"></a>still persist in field-preaching. Others are strangers to our call. I know infinite good hath been done by it already, and greater good will yet be done thereby every day: but we must be judged of our brethren. May <span

    bless you more and more every day, and cause you to triumph in every place. Next <i>Monday</i>, <span

    <span class="dropcap">E</span>VERY letter you write, knits my heart more and more to you in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Your last I received on <i>Saturday</i>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    had been preparing me for it, by a week’s intimation upon my heart, and by an inexpressible agony in my soul just before it came to hand. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that our friends preach up poverty of spirit, for that is the only foundation whereon to build solid abiding comfort. The stony ground received the word with joy; but how did those hearers stand in a day of temptation? They fell away; for it is very possible that the heart may have much joy floating on the top of it, and yet be as hard as the nether millstone. Hence it is that so many, who boast of rest in their flashes of joy, are self-willed, impatient of reproof, despisers of others in a mourning state, and wise in their own conceits: whereas the believer, that hath been with his <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    in the wilderness, and has a truly broken and contrite heart, though his joy may not be so extravagant, yet it is substantial. Such a soul hangs upon <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    thinks before he speaks; and is continually hearkening for what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will say to him, by the small still voice of his spirit. This is the state I want all our friends to arrive at.
    <a id="p191"></a>I cannot see how they can, with assurance, talk of their enjoying solid fellowship with the Father, and his dear Son <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    I shall not be surprized if many, who seemingly began in the spirit, do end in the flesh, and turn persecutors of the doctrines and disciples of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    How can they possibly stand, who never felt themselves condemned criminals? who were never truly burthened with a sense not only of their actual, but original sin, especially that damning sin of unbelief? who were never brought to see and heartily confess, that after they had done all, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    might, notwithstanding, deny them mercy; and that it is owing merely to his sovereign love in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    that they can have any hopes of being delivered from the wrath to come? It is for preaching in this manner that I like <abbr
      title="Mister">Mess.</abbr> <i>T――s</i>.
    They wound deep before they heal; they know that there is no promise made but to him that believeth; and therefore they are careful not to comfort over much those that are convicted. I fear I have been too incautious in this respect, and have often given comfort too soon. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    pardon me for what is past, and teach me more rightly to divide the word of truth for the future. Dearest <i>J――</i>, pardon this freedom; I am constrained to write in this manner. I thank you most heartily for your historical letter. Fail not writing to me often. Dearest <i>J――</i>, help me by your prayers: for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s sake help me. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is yet with us. I hear different accounts of things; but I pray for all, and suspend my judgment till you see</p>

    <i>My dear Sister</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter afforded me much inward pleasure. Surely it bespeaks the writer not to be far from the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. You was then waiting for our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s salvation: ere now, I trust, <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    hath manifested his glory, filled you with his blessed spirit, and thereby sealed you to the day of redemption. ’Tis good to be long in an humbled state: it is the best preparation for solid, lasting comfort. Blessed are
    <a id="p192"></a>they that mourn most, for they shall be the most comforted: not that we are violently to keep ourselves in such a state; but when <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    hand lies heavy upon us, we are patiently to tarry the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    leisure, till he reveals himself to our souls. I was a mourner a long while; but, glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    I have for some years been almost continually comforted; at least kept from doubting of my interest in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I can with an humble boldness cry out, “My <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!”
    He daily manifests himself to my soul, and causes me to feel my dependance on his free grace and sovereign love. This is the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    within us. O, my dear sister, what would I give, were all the world partakers of this unspeakable gift! I long, I burn with an ardent zeal after the salvation of my dear brethren, who are dead in trespasses and sins. Poor souls! Why am I taken, and they left? O the sovereign, free, unmerited, distinguishing love of my and your <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>!
    My dear sister, let us love him, let us obey him; let us suffer for him with a chearful heart! His love will sweeten every cup, though never so bitter. Let us pledge him willingly, and continue faithful even unto death. A scene of sufferings lies before us. Who knows but we may wade to our Saviour through a sea of blood? I expect (O pray that I may be strengthened if called to it) to die for his great name’s sake. ’Twill be sweet to wear a martyr’s crown. Dear Madam, adieu. I remember <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    goodness to us at <i>Broad-Oaks</i>. I pray for you and yours. I trust your daughters keep close to <span

    who hath translated you from darkness to light; from the power of Satan to the service of the ever-living <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Now know I, that our glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> has not commanded
    <a id="p193"></a>us to pray in vain. Surely we shall never taste of death, till we see our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    kingdom coming with greater power. He seems to be thrusting out more labourers into his harvest. Glory be to his free grace that you are one of the happy number. O dear Sir, rejoice and be exceeding glad; and let the love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    constrain you to go out into the highways and hedges to compel poor sinners to come in. Some (even that are true lovers of the Lamb) may say “this is not proceeding with a zeal according to knowledge:” but I am persuaded, when the power of religion revives, the gospel must be propagated in the same manner as it was first established, “<i>itinerant preaching</i>.” Go on, dear Sir, go on, and follow your glorious Master without the camp, bearing his sacred reproach. Never fear the scourge of the tongue, or the threatnings that are daily breathed out against the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>, and against his <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Suffer we must, I believe, and that great things. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    by his providence, begins to shew it. Ere long, perhaps, we may sing in a prison, and have our feet set fast in the stocks. But faith in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    turns a prison into a palace, and makes a bed of flames become a bed of down. Let us be faithful to-day, and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will support us to-morrow. O dear Sir, though I know you not, yet my heart is enlarged towards you, and I make mention of your name in my prayers. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to give you strength to bear the heat and burden of every day, and to enable you to preach with such wisdom, that all your adversaries may not be able to gainsay or resist. Blessed be his holy name, I drink deep of his love every moment. A greater power than ever attends my poor labours; and several of my own houshold, both boys and girls, I really believe, are coming savingly to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I am now about to go to <i>Charles-Town</i>; a work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is begun there. Who knows but I may see my dear brother <i>S――</i> in <i>America</i>? But future things belong to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    to his grace and love I commend you. Keep close to your dear <span

Since that time, I have received many agreeable letters from <i>England</i>; but find from <i>Blendon letters</i> that Miss <i>E―― D――</i> is in a seeking state only. Surely that will not do; I would have one that is full of faith and the Holy Ghost. Just now I have been weeping, and much carried out in prayer before the <span

    My poor family gives me more concern than every thing else put together. I want a <i>gracious woman</i> that is dead to every thing but <span

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>:
    and he is so infinitely condescending, that he daily grants me fresh tokens of his love, and assures me that he will not permit me to fall by the hands of a woman. I am almost tempted to wish I had never undertook the orphan-house. At other times, I am willing to contrive matters so that I may not marry: but I am always checked; and looking back upon the workings of my heart in this affair, I am more and more convinced that it is of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    and therefore know he will order affairs for me, as will best promote his own glory. So that my dear <span

O my dear brother, still continue faithful to my soul: do not hate me in your heart; in any wise reprove me.

I have abundant reason to bless <span

    I am frequently at <i>Calvary</i>, and frequently on <i>Mount Tabor</i>; but always assured of my <span

    since my departure. You have done well: you never can be zealous for a better master: but why,

    that you may always feel yourself a very poor sinner, and find refuge in the wounds and blood of the Lamb. I rejoice to hear the work of <span

For that reason, I would not take you to <i>Georgia</i>. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I have no such over-forward spirits there. My dear <i>B――</i>, I write in love. For <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake try your spirit: I fear you was never yet truly humbled. I know you have had joy; but I always thought it was joy floating on the surface of an unmortified heart. From such a joy, good <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    deliver us! O that you had been in the wilderness a little longer! then you might have been an experienced teacher; but I fear you are now only a novice. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    keep you from falling into the condemnation of the devil. I write not this to damp, but to regulate your spirit; if you are humble, you will take it kind. <span
      class="smcap">God</span> knows, I wish all the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    servants were prophets; but I would not have my Master’s work suffer by a too heady way of proceeding. Why should you dishonour him by acting above your sphere;
    <a id="p197"></a>whereas you might honour him by acting in it. Every one is not fit to be a public expounder. To build up awakened sinners in private, is what is more wanted at present than young unexperienced preachers. But I have done; I fear I have offended my brother: forgive me this wrong. As <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased first to work upon you by my ministry, you must always expect to be watched over by</p>

    I have been here above a week. The <span

    hath been pleased to work on many hearts. On <i>Sunday</i> the <i>commissary</i> denied me the sacrament; but my dear Master fed me, notwithstanding, with the bread which cometh down from heaven. Persecution seems to be coming on more and more. My dear friend, see that you are rooted and grounded in love and faith; or how will you stand fast in a dying hour? With difficulty I write this before morning service. I preach generally, in town or country, twice a-day. The heat is great; but the <span

Many souls are awakened to a sense of the divine life.—The alteration in the people since I came here at first, is surprizing. I preach twice a day, generally, either in town or in the villages around. The commissary shoots out his arrows, even bitter words.

By this means I shall have liberty to preach the gospel without further interruption, and my call to <i>England</i> will be more clear.

    (after being pleased to bring me low by bodily sickness) now gives me liberty to write to you. Whilst I am writing, I find my heart united with yours. I hope we have both drank into the same spirit, and are both instances of the same sovereign, distinguishing, everlasting love. O let us extol it! O let us improve daily! And since <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    sees fit that we shall not die, but live, let us lay ourselves out to declare the works of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I am ashamed of my past unfruitfulness. Had others received the stock, that hath been intrusted to me, how would they have improved it? Indeed I am an unprofitable servant. In the righteousness of <span

    <a id="p202"></a>should be so froward as to oblige the <span

    of love to strike me with his rod. But oh the goodness of the <span

    His rod, as well as staff, do comfort and build up my soul. I would not but be tried for ten thousand worlds. Blessed be <span

    I am enabled to clasp the cross, and desire to glory in nothing more. Dear brother, help me with your prayers. Our victorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    makes his power to be known; many have I seen struck quite down by the power of the word. The holy Ghost hath often come like a mighty rushing wind. Satan has desired to sift us as wheat. But our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    still shews me, that the orphan-house will go on and flourish. It is often a great weight upon my soul; but through your and my dear friends prayers, the <span

    I am persuaded will still support it.</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been pleased to bring me low, for some time, by inward weakness, and faintness of spirits. The first strength that is given me to write, I make use of in writing to you. The <span

    is purging me, that I may bring forth more fruit. I long to die, not that I may be rid of crosses, but that I may be with <span

    He draws me more and more to him every day. I have had many close domestic trials of late. But these words, “David strengthened himself in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> his <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,”
    came with sweet power to my soul. I find, the nearer I come to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    the closer my trials are. I have been sometimes through weakness kept from preaching; but when I have spoken, the word
    <a id="p203"></a>has come with power. I have reason to think, that three persons who came to see the orphan-house, have been effectually called by our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    I have now some <i>Carolina</i> visitors in my house; two of them, I believe, are coming truly to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.—The
    word runs like lightning in <i>Charles-Town</i>. A serious lively Baptist minister, named <i>Tilly</i>, is here also; he has preached often for me, and last <i>Sunday</i> received the sacrament in our way.—O bigotry, thou art tumbling down a-pace! Blessed be <span

    wonderfully provides for my orphans.—I am kept from every degree of doubting; nay, the <span

    fills me daily with a full assurance of faith. He chastens and corrects me, but it is all in love. O help me to praise him, and thereby add to the obligations already laid on, dear <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">L</span>AST night I had the pleasure of receiving an extract of your journal.—This morning I took a walk and read it. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to give it his blessing. Many things I trust will prove beneficial, especially the account of yourself. Only, give me leave with all humility to exhort you not to be strenuous in opposing the doctrines of <i>election</i> and <i>final perseverance</i>, when, by your own confession, “you have not the witness of the spirit within yourself,” and consequently are not a proper judge. I remember dear brother <i>E――</i> told me one day, that “he was convinced of the perseverance of the saints.” I told him, you was not. He replied, but he will be convinced when he hath got the spirit himself. I am assured, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has now for some years given me this living witness in my soul. I cannot say, I have since indulged any doubts (at least for no considerable time) about the forgiveness of my sins; nay, I can scarce say, that I ever doubted at all. When I have been nearest death, my evidences have been the clearest. I can say, I have been on the borders of <i>Canaan</i>, and do every day, nay, almost every moment, long for the appearing of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>;
    not to evade sufferings, but with a single desire to see his blessed face. I feel his blessed spirit daily filling my soul and body, as plain as I feel the air
    <a id="p205"></a>which I breathe, or the food I eat.—Perhaps the doctrines of election and of final perseverance hath been abused, (and what doctrine has not,) but notwithstanding, it is children’s bread, and ought not in my opinion to be with-held from them, supposing it is always mentioned with proper cautions against the abuse. <i>Dear</i> and <i>Honoured Sir</i>, I write not this to enter into disputation. I hope, at this time, I feel something of the meekness and gentleness of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I cannot bear the thoughts of opposing you: but how can I avoid it, if you go about (as your brother <i>C――</i> once said) to drive <i>John Calvin</i> out of <i>Bristol</i>. Alas, I never read any thing that <i>Calvin</i> wrote; my doctrines I had from <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    and his apostles; I was taught them of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>; and as <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased to send me out first, and to enlighten me first, so I think he still continues to do it. My business seems to be chiefly in planting; if <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    send you to water, I praise his name.—I wish you a thousand-fold increase. I find, by young <i>W――</i>’s letter, there is disputing among you about <i>election</i>, and <i>perfection</i>.—I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to put a stop to it, for what good end will it answer?—I wish I knew your principles fully; did you write oftner, and more frankly, it might have a better effect than silence and reserve. I have lately had many domestic trials, and that about points of doctrine, not by myself, but from others in my absence. I daily wait upon <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    depending on his promise, that all things, even this, shall work together for my good. Many in <i>Charles-Town</i>, I believe, are called of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    You may now find a christian, without searching the town as with a candle. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    is less furious, at least in public. He hath expended all his strength, and finds he cannot prevail. Adieu, <i>Honoured Sir</i>, Adieu! My health is better, since I last left <i>Charles Town</i>, and am now freed from domestic cares. With almost tears of love to you, and the brethren, do I subscribe myself, honoured Sir,</p>

The one single point which it contains, is this query, “Whether the commissary of <i>South-Carolina</i> has power given him from your Lordship, to exercise any <i>judicial authority</i> against me, or any other clergyman, who doth not belong to his province?” The reason of my putting this question, I suppose your Lordship will be apprized of, before this reaches your Lordship’s hands.
    <a id="p207"></a>I have been lately cited to appear in an ecclesiastical court, erected by the <i>Reverend</i> <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>,
    for not reading the common prayer in the meeting-house, which I was obliged to preach in at <i>Charles-Town</i>, (unless I would be silent) because the commissary would not let me have the use of his church. I appeared, and have appealed, according to law, to four of his majesty’s commissioners for reviewing appeals, to know, whether the commissary ought not to have accepted a <i
      lang="la" xml:lang="la">Recusatio judicis</i>,
    which I lodged in court. This, I suppose, they will determine. I only desire your Lordship’s explicit opinion and determination, whether <abbr

    enable me to send you an answer of peace. <i>Sinless perfection</i>, I think, is unattainable in this life. Shew me a man that could ever justly say, “I am perfect.” It is enough if we can say so, when we bow down our heads and give up the ghost. <i>Indwelling sin</i> remains till death, even in the regenerate, as the article of the church expresses it.—There is no man that liveth and sinneth not in thought, word, and deed: However, to affirm such a thing as perfection, and to deny <i>final perseverance</i>, what an absurdity is this? To be incapable of sinning, and capable of being finally damned, is a contradiction in terms. From such doctrine may I ever turn away! Labour, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A.</i> to be holy, even as <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is holy; but do not look for complete perfection here below. What is this, but in effect to vacate the righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>?
    I hear many amongst you who begun in the spirit, are now ending in the flesh. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    hath freely justified them, <abbr
      title="that is"><i>i. e.</i></abbr>
    entitled them to all his merits, and yet they must do so and so to keep themselves in a justified state. Alas, this is sorry divinity; I have not so learned <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    No, his gifts and callings are without repentance. Whom he loves, he loves to the end. Work I will, but not to keep myself in a justified state. My <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath secured that; but I will work to shew my gratitude for his putting me into a justified state. O that all would study the covenant of grace. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A.</i>
    I feel that I love you, and I find myself carried out to write in this manner. My <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    blesses me with all spiritual blessings; he causes me to rejoice in his salvation. I pray him to carry on his work in <i>London</i>, and to keep his church from errors; but there must be a sifting as well as a gathering time. It is meet that such offences should come. All shall work together for good to those who are <i>called after <span

    <i>Honoured Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS is sent in answer to your letter dated <i>March 25</i>.—I think, I have for some time known what it is to have righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. These, I
    <a id="p211"></a>believe, are the privileges of the sons of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>:
    But I cannot say I am free from indwelling sin; no, I find a law in my members warring against the law of my mind: This makes me to cry out, even now, “Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” I thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>
    will. I cannot see wherein the heterodoxy of the article of our church doth consist, which says, “That this corruption remains even in the regenerate;” and if that after conversion we cannot sin in thought, word or deed, I do not know why our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    taught us to pray to our heavenly Father, “Forgive us our trespasses.” I am sorry, honoured Sir, to hear by many letters, that you seem to own a <i>sinless perfection</i> in this life attainable. I think I cannot answer you better, than a venerable old minister in these parts answered a Quaker. “Bring me a man that hath really arrived to this, and I will pay his expences, let him come from where he will.” I know not what you may think, I do not expect to say indwelling sin is finished and destroyed in me, till I bow down my head and give up the ghost. There must be some <i>Amalekites</i> left in the <i>Israelites</i> land, to keep his soul in action, to keep him humble, and to drive him continually to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    for pardon and forgiveness. I know many abuse this doctrine, and perhaps wilfully indulge sin, or do not aspire after holiness, because no man is perfect in this life. But what of that? must I therefore assert doctrines contrary to the gospel? <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    forbid. Whether the seventh to the <i>Romans</i>, is applicable to a converted person (as many very eminent saints have thought) is not at all to the purpose: There are other passages of scripture, which plainly shew that sinless perfection is not attainable here below. Such as these, “There is no man that liveth and sinneth not.” “In many things we offend all.” And I know no sin except the sin against the Holy Ghost, of which a child of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> may not be guilty, if <span
      class="smcap">God</span> should withdraw his grace.</p>
  <p>
    Whatever you may think of <i>David</i>, the scripture says, “He was a man after <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    own heart;” yet how did he fall? And if you will not permit <i>Peter</i> to have been converted when he denied his Master; what will you say to <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>?
    Did not he sin, do you think, (at least were not his passions irregular,
    <a id="p212"></a>and what is that but sin) when he spoke to the High Priest, and called him whited wall? Besides, dear Sir, what a fond conceit is it to cry up <i>perfection</i>, and yet cry down the doctrine of <i>final perseverance</i>? But this, and many other absurdities you will run into, because you will not own <i>Election</i>: And you will not own Election, because you cannot own it without believing the doctrine of <i>Reprobation</i>. What then is there in reprobation so horrid? I see no blasphemy in holding that doctrine, if rightly explained. If <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    might have passed by all, he may pass by some. Judge whether it is not a greater blasphemy to say, “<span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    died for souls now in hell.” Surely, dear Sir, you do not believe there will be a general <i>gaol delivery</i> of damned souls hereafter. O that you would study the covenant of grace! O that you were truly convinced of sin, and brought to the foot of sovereign grace! <i>Elisha Cole on <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    sovereignty</i>, and <i>Veritas Redux</i>, written by Doctor <i>Edwards</i>, are well worth your reading. But I have done; if you think so meanly of <i>Bunyan</i>, and the Puritan writers, I do not wonder that you think me wrong. I find your sermon has had its expected success; it hath set the nation a disputing; you will have enough to do now to answer pamphlets; two I have already seen. O that you would be more cautious in casting lots! O that you would not be too rash and precipitant! If you go on thus, <i>honoured Sir</i>, how can I concur with you? It is impossible; I must speak what I know.—Thus I write out of the fulness of my heart: I feel myself to be a vile sinner.—I look to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>;
    I mourn because I have pierced him. Honoured Sir, pray for me. The <span

    be with your dear soul. About Spring you may expect to see,</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    sometimes in the fields, and sometimes in the meeting-houses. My health is much restored by the coolness of the air.—I intend staying about a month in these parts, then to go to <i>Philadelphia</i> by land, from thence to <i>Georgia</i> by water, and I hope to embark for <i>England</i> the beginning of the Spring.—You see by this, dear friend, how our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    works by my unworthy hands. Ministers and people, I believe, will be much quickened.—I hope your dear soul prospers. For <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake avoid disputing; study your heart and the scriptures; get nearer and nearer to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    he will lead you into all truth. My most tender love to all; if opportunity any way offers, every letter received shall be answered by, dear dear <abbr

    <i>My dear Brother, I――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you for your kind letter. It is the first I have received from you since I left <i>England</i>.—I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    the work goes on in <i>Yorkshire</i>.—May our glorious, sin-forgiving <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    bless you and your spiritual children more and more! I find, our friends are got into deputing one with another.—O that the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of peace may put a stop to it! I wish many may not be building on a false foundation, and rest in a false
    <a id="p214"></a>peace. They own <i>free justification</i>, and yet seem to think, that their continuance in a justified state depends on their doings, and their wills.—This, I think, is establishing a righteousness of our own. My dear brother, if we search the scriptures, we shall find that the word <i>justified</i> implies not only pardon of sin, but also all its consequences.—“Thus (says Saint <i>Paul</i>) those whom he justified, them he also glorified;” so that if a man was once justified, he remains so to all eternity.—Here lies the anchor of all my hopes.—Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    having once loved me, he will love me to the end.—This fills me with joy unspeakable and full of glory.—I now walk by faith.—I work not to keep myself in a justified state, (for men or devils can never pluck me out of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    hands,) but to express my love and gratitude for what <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath done for my soul. This, I think, is what the apostle calls “faith working by love.” My dear brother, my heart’s desire and prayer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is, that we may all think and speak the same things.—For, if we are divided among ourselves, what an advantage will satan get over us? Let us love one another, excite all to come to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span> without exception, and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will shew us, who are his. The work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    goes on exceedingly in <i>America</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased to manifest himself unto my soul more and more. I am a naughty, stubborn child; but my dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will have mercy because he will have mercy. It is owing to his distinguishing love that I am not hardened. Here is, and I believe will be a great quickning in these parts.—The cloud seems to be moving. Perhaps in the Spring we may meet face to face. With difficulty I get time to write this, but I must answer dear Brother <i>I――</i>’s letter.—May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    be continually with your spirit, and make your soul brimful of peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. I love you in the bowels of the crucified Lamb. May he unite us more and more intimately to his dear self, and to one another. Salute all that love him in sincerity.—Brethren, pray for us.—That you may be kept by <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    power to eternal salvation, is the prayer of</p>

    <i>Boston, September 28, 1740.</i></p>
  <p class="vm_00">
    <i>Dear Brother W――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you for your kind letter from <i>Osset</i>; I wish it was written with more life. I fear you are turning almost to a spirit of bondage: but it is good for you to be sifted, to make an experienced minister of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I could not but smile, to find you wink at the <i>decency of my dress</i>. Alas! my brother, I have known long since what it is to be in that state you are (in my opinion) about to enter into. I myself thought once that christianity required me to go nasty. I neglected myself as much as you would have me, for above a twelvemonth: but when <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gave me the spirit of adoption, I then dressed <i>decently</i>, as you call it, out of principle: and I am more and more convinced, that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    would have me act, in that respect, as I do. But I am almost ashamed to mention any such thing: rather let us talk and write of the love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>;
    “Let us stand fast in the liberty wherewith <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    hath made us free, and not be again entangled in a yoke of bondage.” <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows whether you have done right in leaving the university, or in declining to exhort. If you do not preach till you are perfectly free from all sin, I believe you will never preach again. I could never hear of such a minister or christian yet. My dear brother, I speak freely to you, because I love you in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    He sent his disciples to preach before they were perfect; nay, when they were weak in grace. Exercise the talents you have, and that is the way to get more. Thus has <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    dealt with me for these seven years. “To him that hath, shall be given.” Many of our friends talk against election: a good reason may be given. I believe they have never taken pains to search into the true state of the case. What if some abuse that doctrine; is it therefore false? No; by no means. I am persuaded, if any of our friends would examine their experiences, they would find that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    freely prevented them by his grace; that he compelled them to come in; and that it is not owing to themselves, but to the will and promise of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that they are now kept in a state of
    <a id="p216"></a>grace. But I will say no more. My dear brother, I love you. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    lead you into all truth. Our dear Master is doing wonders among us. Praise him lustily, and with a good courage. Adieu. Dear <i>J―― S――</i> salutes you and the brethren, as does</p>

    enable him to rejoice and be exceeding glad. Dear Sir, the welfare of dear <i>Boston</i> people, especially the welfare of your own soul, lies upon me night and day. I remember your tears: I remember your excellency’s words, “<abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Whitefield</i>,
    pray that I may hunger and thirst after righteousness.” O how did these words rejoice me! for I thought your excellency wanted a more clear view of your own vileness, and of the all-sufficiency of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>;
    I mean a more clear, experimental view: for what is all head-knowledge without that of the heart? it only settles people more upon their lees. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give you to see and to follow the simplicity of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    Whilst you are in the world, may you not be of it: may you be dead to magnificence, and alive to nothing but what leads you directly to your <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Honoured Sir</i>, I make no apology for this freedom: your excellency bid me not spare rulers; no, not the chief of them. Indeed I long after your salvation; O that I could do any thing to promote it! If my prayers, or any thing within my power may be instrumental thereunto, your excellency may command, honoured Sir,</p>

    <i>Dear Brother L――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Wrote to you last week from <i>New-York</i>. You may give friends this brief account of me: On last <i>Saturday</i> evening I arrived at this place, having preached at <i>Staten Island</i>, <i>Newark</i>, <i>Baskenridge</i>, <i>New Brunswick</i>, and <i>Trenton</i>, in my way hither from <i>New York</i>. A wonderful presence of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was observable at <i>New-York</i>, <i>Baskenridge</i>, and <i>Newark</i>. I preached here
    <a id="p223"></a>twice yesterday, and also to-day, in a large house built by the people since I was here last. It is an hundred feet long, and seventy feet wide; and is intended for a school, as well as a place for public worship. The walls are brick, and the roof is now almost ready to be put up. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath remarkably appeared in the carrying on the building; and the holy spirit hath sweetly moved on the hearers souls every time I preached in it. I intend, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to stay here this, and to embark for <i>Georgia</i> the latter end of next week; and propose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to return to <i>England</i> for a short time, in the Spring.</p>
  <p>
    The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> highly favours me; I am more sick of myself, and more in love with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    daily: he is a dear, dear Master: Oh that all would love him with all their hearts! Adieu: it is late. The <span

    mightily reveals his arm. It would please you to see his outgoings, his stately steps in the great congregation. I only want fellow-labourers. I look to <span

    <i>Dear Brother C――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR late letters, especially that which you sent me by way of <i>Charles-Town</i>, made me smile.—I was glad to find that you had not so far thrown off all outward things, as to resolve not to write to any one; and I thought I knew the frame of your heart, as though I was within you. My dear, dear <i>George C――</i>, I love you tenderly in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and therefore would not have you be deceived. Alas, why do you pervert this text of scripture, “Be still, and know that I am the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,”
    as if it was designed to keep a christian from striving, or meant a <i>stillness of body</i>, or waiting upon <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only in silence? The expression is taken out of the <abbr
      title="forty-sixth">46th</abbr> Psalm, where <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s fury against the heathen is
    <a id="p228"></a>described in the most lively colours; and then lest his people should complain of the severity of his dispensations, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    commands them to be <i>still</i>, “not to murmur or repine, knowing that he was the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and might do what seemed him good.” Thus <i>Tate</i> and <i>Brady</i> in their translations explain it, and this is the true and genuine meaning of that sentence. It hath no reference to stillness in prayer, or stillness of body. Dear brother, I speak to you plainly, because I love you. I think I know what it is to wait upon the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    in silence, and to feel the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    making intercession for me with groanings which cannot be uttered. Often have I been at such times filled as it were with the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and I do now daily carry on a communion with the most high <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and the ever-blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    But all this I fear is contrary to the <i>false stillness</i>, you and some others seem to have fallen into. I was just in the same case some years ago at <i>Oxford</i>, when I declined writing, reading, and such like exercises, because I would be <i>still</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    convinced me; I pray he may also convince you of this delusion. Dear <i>George</i>, consider how contrary your maxim is to our Saviour’s. You say, “<i>Be still.</i>” He says, “<i>Strive.</i>” As in an agony, “Strive that you may enter in at the strait gate.” Indeed, my dear man, I pity you, knowing you have but a weak judgment, though a well-meaning heart. You once thought that you was born again; then, you found it was only an elapse of the Holy Ghost. You used to say, you wished you could believe from experience in the doctrine of election; now, you find as yet no evidence within yourself that you are a real christian. You take too much refuge, I fear, in the doctrine of <i>universal redemption</i>. It is the finest doctrine in the world to cause a soul to be falsely still, and to say <i>Peace, Peace</i>, when there is no peace. You seem to insist upon sinless perfection, and to think a man hath no real salvation till he literally cannot commit sin. From whose experience do you write this? Not from your <i>own</i>, dear <i>George</i>; for I much question, if ever your heart was truly broken or had a saving closure with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    You seem to mention <i>Peter Bochler</i> as an instance; but alas, though he has been washed in the blood of the Lamb, so as to be justified from all his sins, yet like me his feet want washing still, and will,
    <a id="p229"></a>till he bows down his head and gives up the ghost. I have conversed with him intimately. Take heed, brother, of having any thing too much in admiration, or of thinking you must necessarily find <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    at such and such a place. You have been at <i>M――</i>. I believe you have seen many dear children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>; but have you returned home with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    in your heart? Your letters do not speak much improvement in the school of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>. If <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    loves you, he will let you see the vanity of your present imaginations, and bring you to see that salvation is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of <span

      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    and his apostles have spoken. I speak this out of love, and not in reference to myself. If <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    blesses another ministry to your soul, I rejoice, yea and will rejoice. But if I see you fall into errors, do not be angry if I tell you the truth. If you are, I will notwithstanding love and pray for you. That errors are crept in among you, I think is too plain: but I suspend my judgment till the Spring, when, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I hope to be in <i>London</i>. In the mean while pray for me, that I may with joy bear to be deserted by those, who once were blessed and awakened by my ministry, and to whom I am a spiritual father, though they may have many instructors. Dear <i>George</i>, may the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    be with you. He only knows how dear you are to my heart. It is near midnight; but it was much upon my heart to write you this letter. That <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> am now going to <i>Charles-Town</i>, in order to embark for <i>England</i>; the cloud of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s providence seems to be
    <a id="p230"></a>moving that way; I have enjoyed much of the divine presence since I left <i>Boston</i>, and have had a comfortable Christmas with my dear family at <i>Georgia</i>. At my return, I found my Orphan-houshold removed from <i>Savannah</i> to <i>Bethesda</i>, and great improvements made during the time of my absence. The great house will be finished, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, so as to be habitable, in about two months. It would have been finished so far by this time, if the <i>Spaniards</i> had not taken a schooner loaded with bricks and other provisions to a considerable value; but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    about the same time stirred up the heart of a planter in <i>South-Carolina</i>, lately brought home at the orphan-house to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    to send my family some rice and beef. At other times, when they have wanted food, the <i>Indians</i> have brought plenty of venison. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    every day, more and more convinces us that this work is of him. His power has been made known, especially among the young ones. I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I have settled my family to my great satisfaction, and verily believe I shall live to see great things come from the Orphan-house. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    works upon the hearts of the labourers. One woman hath had a glorious discovery of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    made to her heart: last week, two or three men where brought into heart-distress, and another young man that came to see us, was made so sick of sin, as to feel the want of, and to enquire after the great and all-powerful physician of souls. My family, I think, consists now of 89 persons. Next year my expences will be contracted much; but at present, I am in debt about 500<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
    sterling. However, I know in whom I have believed, <span
      class="smcap">One</span>
    who is able to pay it. My public accounts will be published as soon as I arrive at <i>London</i>, with a prospect of the Orphan-house, and other little houses and gardens annexed unto it. I am now at the house of one <i><abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> Jonathan B――</i>,
    who, I trust, with his brother <i><abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> H―― B――</i>,
    and another young man, lately a player in <i>New-York</i>, are settled by a living faith in <span

    The latter, I intend for the ministry. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H―― B――</i>’s

    He heaps kindnesses on me every hour. We have hitherto had a wonderful pleasant passage. I hope it is in some measure owing to your prayers. Let this encourage you to pray again. Our <span

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    seemed to give me a full assurance, that we should have a speedy passage.—We have hitherto had scarce any contrary winds, and are now very near the Western Islands. We had one storm the first week, but almost ever since have been favoured with weather as well as wind. O that you would call the family together, and praise the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    for the mercies conferred on us the unworthiest of the sons of men! I do not know that I have failed praying for you one day, since I have been out. I long to hear what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath done for your souls. What say you? Do you live in love? Do you strive together with me in your prayers? Are any of the Orphan Lambs bleating after their great Shepherd? Is your mouth opened? Is your heart enlarged? Is your soul swallowed up in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    Does <i>Bethesda</i> answer its name? Is it, indeed, an house of mercy? These questions, I hope to have answer’d in the affirmative. If you ask, how it is with my soul? Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I can reply, “Very well.” The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gives me a feeling possession of himself. I have been enabled to compose <i>nine discourses</i> for the press. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, you shall hear from me often. I write this, that I may be ready, if I should hear of any ship coming your way immediately upon my arrival; receive it as a token of my love, which <span

    and melted down by the love of my dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    It is almost too big to speak. I will give it vent by writing to you. Our master hath been exceeding gracious, and has shewn me several tokens for good, which I desired of him in secret prayer. Last night, I think I received as full satisfaction as I could desire, in respect to <i>my marriage</i>. I believe what I have done, is of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    tho’ I know not when my heart was more disengaged from earthly thoughts than now. I only desire, that the dear <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    may be glorified in me, whether it be by life or by death. I depend on your sending me a particular account of affairs at <i>Charles-Town</i>. I have wrote to many; you will hear how my letters are received. I shall be glad to hear how it is with your own soul. I beseech you to live near to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and to keep up a holy walk with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. Be inward with <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in your duties. Trust and hang on <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    even when he hides himself from you. He will be your guide unto death. Hunger and thirst daily after the righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Be content with no degree of sanctification. Be always crying out, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    let me know more of myself and of thee; O let me receive grace for grace of thy dear Son.”
    <a id="p246"></a>This, at present, is the full desire of my soul. I am persuaded the <span

    is love; we cannot think too highly of him; we cannot expect too great things to be done by him. His right hand, I believe, will bring mighty things to pass. I am now entering on a scene of trials. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath sent me on the seas to prepare me for them. Not that I depend on any stock of grace already received, I would look to <span

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>ESTERDAY we humbled ourselves before <span

    and by prayer and fasting sought for a blessing, and direction in all our affairs. I wish I had kept family fasts at <i>Savannah</i>. Suppose you had one monthly at <i>Bethesda</i>? You will see, by dear Brother <i>B――</i>’s letter, the frame of my mind. Since that, I have been a little in the valley, but the <span

    be with you. My love is firm to you at the bottom, tho’ sometimes it hath ebbed and flowed; in heaven it will not be so. On earth it is needful it should; otherwise, how should we learn to cease from man? But I am a worm and no man, and deserve to be the outcast of all people. My eyes are now ready to gush out with water. O the sovereign love of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    in chusing me! My dear friend, let us study to be holy even as he is holy, and walk even as he also walked. Let these be your daily questions, “Am I more like <span

    <a id="p248"></a>Am I more meek and patient? Does my practice correspond with my knowledge, and am I a light to enlighten and enflame all that are around me?” I could say more, but I think to write again when I get on shore. <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have kept your letter by me till now, that I might answer it on my voyage. It speaks the language of a perplexed heart, and plainly shews me, that satan loves to keep us in bondage. My dear Brother, I think you have done wrong in holding your peace. I am sure you once felt that freedom of soul, which you are a stranger to now. The way of duty is the way of safety. Whatever you may say to the contrary, unless you will give the lie to your own experiences, you must confess, that you have indeed tasted of the good word of life. You should, therefore, have went forwards, and not have turned back again, and thereby plunged yourself into darkness; darkness that may be felt. Alas, you have too eagerly embraced principles (I fear) contrary to the gospel of <span

    You are aiming at a false voluntary humility, and are returning back to the flesh pots of <i>Egypt</i>. I know my words will have but little force with some, but I must deliver my soul. <span

I find <i>Luther</i>’s observation to be true: “Times of reformation are times of confusion;” as yet the churches in <i>America</i> are quiet, but I expect a sifting time ere long. My family in <i>Georgia</i> was once sadly shaken, but now, blessed be <span

    and others in <i>South-Carolina</i>. It hath also been serviceable to a dear friend now with me, as also to myself. I cannot well tell you what great things are doing abroad.

    loves me, and sheds his love abroad in my heart abundantly by the Holy Ghost. I have been much assisted in composing some gospel sermons, which I intend for the press. I have sought the <span

    by prayer and fasting, and he assures me, that he will be with me. Whom then should I fear? Hitherto we have had an extraordinary passage, praise the <span

    <i>My dear Brother K――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your kind letter at <i>Savannah</i>, and though I hope to see you face to face soon after you receive this, yet love to your dear soul constrains me to write you an answer before I come on shore.</p>
  <p>
    I find, since my departure, the brethren have fallen into errors. Dear Brother <i>K――</i> will not be offended, if I say, “He, I fear, is one of them;” for his letter bewrayeth him. My dear Brother, you say, “You have been striving a long, long while, but to very little purpose, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>”
    By this, I suppose, you have left off the means, and fallen into <i>stillness</i>; expecting now, that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    will so work upon your heart, that you shall not feel the least stirring of indwelling corruption in your soul; in short, that you shall be completely perfect: This was pretty near my case about six years ago, and now I see why <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    suffered me thus to be tempted, “that I might be more capable of succouring my brethren, now they are tempted.” My dear Brother, let us reason together. “You have been striving (you say) a long while, but to very little purpose.” And what then? must you be therefore still, and strive no more? <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    forbid: No, you are yet to wait at the pool. “Constantly attend on ordinances;” and who knows but by-and-by the loving Saviour may pass by and visit your soul. Have you not, in some degree at least, felt his divine power in the use of the means? Why should not that encourage you to expect more in the same way? But you say, “I find all that is of self is sin.” And do you expect ever to do any thing, or to offer up to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    one sacrifice, without a mixture of sin in it? If you do, indeed you are building a <i>spiritual Babel</i>. My dear Brother, even our most holy thoughts are
    <a id="p252"></a>tinctured with sin, and want the atonement of the Mediator; and therefore, if you leave off striving, because “whatever is of self is sin,” you must never attempt to do any duty whatsoever again. Your stillness hath as much a mixture of self in it, as your striving, and if you proceed in this manner, you must become a professed <i>Quietist</i>. Six weeks did satan keep me under this delusion, but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    helped me in the hour of extremity: May he also help my dear Brother <i>K――</i>! Another error you seem to be fallen into is, “that a man cannot be a christian, at least that he is a very weak one, so long as he finds corruption stirring in his heart.” If I was to urge the seventh to the <i>Romans</i>, you would say, <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>
    only speaks of a man under first-awakenings, and not of a converted man; but my dear Brother, did you ever know a man, that was not really converted, delight in the law of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    after the inner man? And yet such an one the Apostle speaks of in the latter part of that chapter. Be not deceived, we are to be holy as <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is holy; we are to receive grace for grace; every grace that is in the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    is to be transplanted into our hearts; we are to be delivered from the power, but not from the indwelling and being of sin in this life. <i>Hereafter</i>, we are to be presented blameless, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. If you labour after any other perfection here, you will labour in vain. <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>
    had attained no other, when he wrote to the <i>Philippians</i>, and to the other churches: But my dear Brother <i>K――</i> seems to think, “I did wrong in writing to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    to know his sentiments upon several texts of scripture, and in sending for several of <i>Calvin</i>’s books.” And why, my dear Brother, was this wrong? Why you say, “you think it is contrary to <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>
    in his Epistles, when he says, he would not speak other men’s words;” but <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>
    says no such thing: The place you aim at, I believe, is <i><abbr
      title="Second Corinthians">2 Cor.</abbr></i> <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 16.
    “And not to boast in another man’s line, of things made ready to our hand.” My dear Brother, examine the context, and you will find the Apostle means no more than that he would not enter into other men’s labours, as <abbr
      title="verse">ver.</abbr> 15.
    He would not preach where churches were already settled, but go where the gospel had not been delivered. This, and this only, is the meaning of the passage, which dear mistaken <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    <a id="p253"></a><i>K――</i> has wrongly quoted. My dear Brother, did not <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>
    bid <i>Timothy</i> to give himself to reading? What, if the Holy Spirit is to lead us into all truth, does not the Holy Spirit make use of, and lead us by the means? Has he not indited the scriptures? Has he not helped holy men to explain those scriptures? And why may I not, in a due subordination to the Holy Spirit, make use of those men’s writings? Has not my dear Brother <i>K――</i> bought sermons? And why then does “He make use of other men’s words?” O, my dear brother, you are in the wilderness; <span
      class="smcap">God</span> bring you safe out of it.</p>
  <p>
    I suppose, because the Dissenters oppose some of your new principles, you term them enemies; but, my dear Brother, though there are many Christless talkers, and hypocritical formalists among the Dissenters, as no doubt there are some such in the purest church under heaven; yet many of them hold and practice the truth as it is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    But I have done. Count me not your enemy, because I tell you the truth. I expect that great numbers will look shy on me, for thus opposing what I think to be error. Thus the <i>Galatians</i> treated <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>;
    but I must be tried every way. I could add a thousand kind things, but I hope you shortly will have a personal interview with</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Know you will rejoice at the receipt of this: You have abundant reason; the <span

    hath been wonderous kind. We are now flying on the wings of the wind, and if it continues, we hope to be at <i>Cowes</i> the beginning of next week. Your kind presents were of great service to my crazy body. The woman passenger has been serviceable in making us bread; and in short, <span

    has wonderfully ordered all things for our great conveniency and comfort. O that my dear friends at <i>Charles-Town</i>, may hereby be excited to thankfulness on our

    Indeed you are seldom out of mind. Dear <abbr

      class="smcap">God</span>
    sent you to invite me to your house, and I believe the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will plentifully reward both of you, for all your works of faith and labours of love. I think henceforward I must call you <i>Mary</i>, and your husband, I hope, will be truly stiled <i>James</i> the servant of the <span

    and give yourselves up to the guidance of his blessed word and providences day by day. It is a glorious privilege to be led by the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I think I have felt, and do feel, at this time, his sacred influences upon my soul. My body is but weak, though better by much than when I left <i>Charles-Town</i>; however, my soul hath confidence in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    The archers will shoot sorely at me that I may fall; but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will cause my bow to abide in strength, and my arms shall be strengthened by the hands of the mighty <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

      class="smcap">God</span>

  <p class="vm_00">
    <i>My dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Wrote to you immediately on my coming on shore. We arrived at <i>Falmouth</i> last <i>Wednesday</i> was sevennight, and got here the <i>Sunday</i> following.—Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we had a summer’s passage. Many of our friends, I find, are sadly divided, and, as far as I am able to judge, have been sadly misled. Congregations at <i>Moorfields</i>, and <i>Kennington Common</i>, on <i>Sunday</i>, were as large as usual.—On the following week days, quite contrary: Twenty thousand dwindled down to two or three hundred. It has been a trying time with me. A large orphan family, consisting of near a hundred, to be maintained, about four thousand miles off, without the least fund, and in the dearest part of his Majesty’s dominions; also, above a thousand pounds in debt for them, and not worth twenty pounds in the world of my own, and threatened to be arrested for three hundred and fifty pounds, drawn for in favour of the Orphan house, by my late dear deceased friend and fellow-traveller <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>.
    My Bookseller, who, I believe, has got some <i>hundreds</i> by me, being drawn away by the <i>M――ns</i>, refuses to print for me; and many, very many of my spiritual children, who, at my last departure from <i>England</i>, would have plucked out their own eyes to have given to me, are so prejudiced by the dear <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr> <i>W.</i>’s
    dressing up the doctrine of Election in such horrible colours, that they will neither hear, see, nor
    <a id="p257"></a>give me the least assistance: Yea, some of them send threatening letters, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will speedily destroy me. As for the people of the world, they are so imbittered by my <i>injudicious</i>, and <i>too severe expressions</i> against Archbishop <i>Tillotson</i>, and the Author of the old <i>Duty of Man</i>, that they fly from me as from a viper; and what is most cutting of all, I am now constrained, on account of our differing in principles, publicly to separate from my dear, dear old friends <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr>
    <i>J――</i> and <i>C―― W――y</i>, whom I still love as my own soul: But, through infinite mercy, I am enabled to strengthen myself in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I am cast down but not destroyed, perplexed but not in despair. A few days ago, in reading <i>Beza’s Life of Calvin</i>, these words were much pressed upon me, “<i>Calvin</i> is turned out of <i>Geneva</i>, but, behold a new church arises!”—<span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>, the ever loving, altogether lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    pities and comforts me. My friends are erecting a place, which I have called a <i>Tabernacle</i>, for morning’s exposition. I have not, nor can I as yet, make any collections; but let us not fear.—Our heavenly Father, with whom the fatherless find mercy, will yet provide; let us only seek first the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and his righteousness, and all other necessary things shall be added unto us. In about a fortnight, though I scarce know an oak from a hickery, or one kind of land from another, I am subpœna’d to appear before parliament, to give an account of the condition of the province of <i>Georgia</i>, when I left it. This, I suppose, is occasioned by the party, which hath been so inveterate against the honourable the trustees, whom they accuse of misemploying the public monies. The event, which undoubtedly will be in favour of the trust, you may know hereafter. In the mean while, believe me to be</p>

    for knitting us together in love. May it continue, and increase till consummated in eternity! The <span

    direct you. It is now a trying time with the church. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is now chiefly wounded in the house of his friends. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    keep us both from a party spirit on one hand, and from too much rashness and positiveness on the other. I speak thus, because you seem offended that some affirm, “That there is no such thing as dominion over indwelling sin, nor rest from working for life wholly.” Now this is certainly true in one sense. We shall never have such a dominion over indwelling sin, as entirely to be delivered from the stirring of it; and the greatest saint cannot be assured, but some time or other for his humiliation, or punishment for unfaithfulness, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may permit it to break out into some actual breach of his law, and in a gross way too. Let us not be high-minded, but fear. It is equally true, that we shall not rest wholly from working for life. For whilst there is any part of us unregenerate, that part will be always leading us to the old covenant. <i>Luther</i> often complained of the propensity of his heart this way. If we know ourselves, we shall find it to be so with us; but I suppose you have been
    <a id="p260"></a>tinctured with the doctrine of <i>sinless perfection</i>. No wonder therefore you write thus. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give you a right judgment in all things, and enable you rightly to divide the word of truth! As for <i>assurance</i>, I cannot but think, all who are truly converted must know that there was a time in which they closed with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>:
    But then, as so many have died only with an humble hope, and have been even under doubts and fears, though they could not but be looked upon as christians; I am less positive than once I was, lest haply I should condemn some of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    dear children. The farther we go in the spiritual life, the more cool and rational shall we be, and yet more truly zealous. I speak this by experience. Dear brother <i>H――</i> will not be angry with me. I hope, and believe, you pray for me. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    carries me on. Many have been convinced at <i>London</i>. I preach here twice daily, to large congregations, with great power. The <span

      id="p262a" href="#tn_14">♦</a>letter
    from your brother <i>Ralph</i>, who thinks it best for me wholly to join the associate presbytery, if it should please <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to send me into <i>Scotland</i>. This I cannot altogether come into. I come only as an occasional preacher, to preach the simple gospel to all that are willing to hear me, of whatever denomination. It will be wrong in me to join in a reformation as to church government, any further than I have light given me from above. If I am quite neuter as to that in my preaching, I cannot see how it can hinder or retard any design you may have on foot. My business seems to be, to evangelize, to be a Presbyter at large. When I shall be sent into your parts I know not. I write this, that there may not be the least misunderstanding between us. I love and honour the associate Presbytery in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    With this I send them my due respects, and most humbly beg their prayers. But let them not be offended, if in all things I cannot immediately fall in with them. Let them leave me to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Whatever light he is pleased to give me, I hope I shall be faithful to it. Our dear and precious master still carries me on. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    enables me to fight my way through. The gospel
    <a id="p263"></a>doctrines, I believe, will yet prevail. I feel a divine power attending my ministrations. I preach twice daily, and am invited to many places. I believe the <span

    intends to keep me on this side the water for some time. Blessed be <span

    <i>My Brother H―― H――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Do assure you, that my heart is as your heart. I am quite sick of <i>Christless consenters</i>. They talk, and that is all. I (like you) am heartily despised by most of them. I am resolved to open against their luke-warmness, and worldly-mindedness. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    open my mouth wide when I come to <i>Wales</i>. Outward enemies are now more quiet. Enemies within the church, carnal professors, and self-righteous Pharisees, most try us. Let us not fear, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    will give us the victory over all. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    mightily strengthens me. Our congregations are very large and solemn. I never had greater freedom in preaching. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    enables me to cast all my care upon him, with a full assurance that he careth for me. You need not fear my believing any reports to your disadvantage. I love you in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I was not in the least offended, when
    <a id="p269"></a><i>B―― H――</i> wrote me word that “you thought in some things I did not act as a <i>little child</i>.” The more open you are with me the better. If nature and pride rise in my heart, I will go to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    abhor myself, and pray for my dear reprovers. All that I can say is, that I desire to be <i>a very little child</i>. All things are possible with <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    He is wonderfully kind to me. Truth, I believe, will prevail. I want to see you face to face. Satan does not love that <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    ministers should come together. I wish you could come up immediately, and stay at <i>London</i> whilst I am in the country: or rather go and preach at <i>B――l</i>, <i>Gloucester</i>, and <i>Wiltshire</i>, for about a fortnight, and then come up to <i>London</i>. This, I believe, will be best. About that time, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall return from <i>Essex</i>, and then we can consult what is best to be done for the cause of our dear master. O <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is love! I am glad to hear brother <i>Rowl—d</i> is with you. Go on in the strength of our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and you shall see satan like lightning fall from heaven. Times are not yet dark enough for the dawning of a thorough reformation. At even-tide <span
      class="smcap">God</span> speaks. My love to all that follow <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    with an unfeigned simplicity. May the <span

    Your case, methinks, is somewhat like that man of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    <i>J. Bunyan</i>’s. He was often so depressed with a sense of sin in the pulpit, that he has been tempted to hold his peace. This has been my case also both in public and in private. I find the best way is to press forward, and to look up to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    He is faithful to his promises. I write but short, having but little time, and because I hope soon to see you in <i>Essex</i>. I pray <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have been much hindred in answering your letter. Perhaps you have expected too much comfort from man. That comfort is alone lasting, which comes from <span

    I know not your experiences, and therefore cannot so well judge of your case: however, I would have you press forward, and labour after a full assurance of faith. Judge not yourself by others joys and comforts. Look not too much upon the happiness you think others may enjoy. This may lead you to repine and murmur against <span

    <i>My dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">H</span>OW sweetly does providence order all things for us! Just before yours came, I was resolved to send you 20<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
    to begin the society-room at <i>Kingswood</i>. <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    gives it, and I believe will make it up fifty. This gentlewoman hath been made happily instrumental in relieving me out of my late distress. You know how I was threatened to be arrested, soon after my arrival, for above three hundred pounds, due on account of the Orphan-house in <i>Georgia</i>, and I do not know but a writ was actually taken out. This drove me to my knees. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gave me to wrestle, with strong cryings and many tears, both before and after I went to rest—I could plead with him that it was not for myself but his poor. The example of <i>Professor Frank</i> encouraged me to pray, tho’ I found he ventured only week by week; but my situation in such a foreign climate constrained me to run upon larger arrears.—<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased to give me an answer of peace. Having as I thought a full assurance of immediate help from some quarter or another, I went to sleep most comfortably. Early the next morning a friend came to me to enquire, if I knew where a gentlewoman of his acquaintance might put out three or four hundred pounds. I replied, let her lend it to me, and in a few months, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, she shall have it again.—Upon being acquainted with my circumstances, she most chearfully sent me the sum I wanted, and thus my enemies were disappointed of their hope. Praise the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    O my soul!—But to return. I would have you lay the foundation immediately, but take care of building too large or too handsome. Notwithstanding my
    <a id="p272"></a>present embarrassments, who knows, but it may be in my power to discharge my Orphan-house debt, and make collections here for <i>Kingswood-school</i> too? When I could get no assistance at all from my old friends and spiritual (prejudiced) children, and was almost quite pennyless, and left to sit alone like a sparrow upon the house-top, a serious person, whom I never saw or <a
      id="p272a" href="#tn_16">♦</a>heard
    of, came the other day and put a guinea into my hand. At receiving it, something as it were said to me, “Cannot that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    who sent this person to give thee this guinea, make it up fifteen hundred?” As I told a friend immediately, to whom I ran down, so I shall tell you; I doubt not but this will be the case. My debt is all for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and contracted in providing for the fatherless and widow. As to the work here, though perhaps I may be blamed by some for venturing so far, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it goes on sweetly. All things happen for the furtherance of the gospel. I have wrote brother <i>S――</i> to let you have twenty pounds.</p>

    Perhaps I may never see you again on this side eternity. O that we may approve ourselves good soldiers of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>!
    How bright will our crown be then, at that last great day! I find there is nothing
    <a id="p284"></a>like being valiant for the truth. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    is a glorious captain. He makes me more than conqueror through his love. I have seen great things, within these few months. I should have answered you sooner, but could not get time till now: I am embarked for <i>Scotland</i>. I hope you take particular care to beat down self-righteousness, and exalt the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    alone in your hearts. I find, the only happiness is to lie down as a poor sinner at the feet of the once crucified, but now exalted Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who died for our sins and rose again for our justification. I rejoice to hear, that some even at <i>Gibraltar</i> still dare to own a too too much neglected Saviour. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the governor is so favourable to you. This is a great motive to love and thankfulness. The work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    still goes on in <i>England</i>, and other parts. O for that glorious period, when the whole earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the <span

    <i>Dear Miss</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span> Few hours ago I came on board. To shew that you are in my mind, I employ some of my first leisure time in answering your letter. The condition you are in now, ought not to make you think that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    has cast you off, and that it will be presumption in you to believe on him. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is now shewing you, that you are poor, and miserable, and blind, and naked, and such only are the persons that think they want his almighty aid. I fear you look too much into yourself, and from thence are discouraged. Whereas you should look directly to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and come to him in all your blood. You will always fly from him, as long as you count him your enemy. But do not think so hardly of him; <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is the sinner’s friend. O how doth his bowels yearn towards you! Are you made willing to be made whole? <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    invites and commands you to come to him; venture then upon him.
    <a id="p285"></a>If you never have believed yet, it is time for you to believe <i>now</i>. “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    give me faith!” for faith is the free gift of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. What if your heart be hard, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    can soften it. What if you have yet no marks of your election? surely you dare not say, “You are not elected,” or that <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    hath not died for you, even for you. It is, indeed, a bad thing to have only notions in the head, and no solid experience in the heart. But it is a good thing to be convinced of this. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who hath given you to bewail it. Look upon this as a token for good.—Trust not to means; when they are taken from you, <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    can and will work without them. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    may bring you help in a way, and at a time you know not of. Your extremity shall be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s opportunity. If the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    vouchsafes to bless this letter in the least degree to your comfort, it will much rejoice the heart of, dear Miss,</p>

    Give it all to him, give it to him, hard, earthly, sensual, devilish, as it is. He will wash it in his precious blood. Do not tie him down to any degree of conviction. So that he brings you home, let him do it in that way he shall think best. What a loving Saviour have you to deal with! You cannot conceive how kind he is, even <i>to me</i> every day. I feel and see his power more and more. He seems to be beginning his work afresh in <i>England</i>, and it gladdens my heart to hear he is among you at <i>Bethesda</i>. O do nothing to grieve the blessed spirit! Let your conversation be
    <a id="p286"></a>such in all things, as becomes the gospel of the blessed <span

    Have the greatest regard for the little lambs. Do nothing that may prove a stumbling block to their precious souls. Warm yourself by talking to them. Be not one moment idle. Redeem your precious time; for you know not when your <span

But see what comfort another passage may afford you, “Go tell my brethren and <i>Peter</i>.” Poor, weeping, penitent <i>Peter</i> must in no wise be forgotten. “Go tell them that I am risen.” Here are glad tidings of great joy to a disconsolate soul. May <span

    will surely visit your offences with a rod, and your backslidings with some spiritual scourge.

This, as well as your other past favours, quite surprize, and ought to humble me; for who am I, that I should be thus highly honoured? O sovereign grace! O distinguishing love! If I did not stand up in defence of that, the very stones would cry out against me. Indeed, honoured Sir, your kindness makes me almost to blush, and the love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    quite confounds me. I am lost, I want to sink into nothing whenever I think of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    dying for me. I really think, I am the most ungrateful sinner that ever was, and yet the Redeemer follows me with his mercies every day. Unspeakable are the trials wherewith I have been visited since my arrival. But out of all the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    delivers me. I experience daily much of his divine presence; a wider door than ever is opened for preaching the everlasting gospel, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    seems to be beginning his work again in <i>Old-England</i>: it adds to my joy, to hear what the <span

    is doing amongst you. Blessed, for ever blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    for causing such a stirring among the dry bones. I pray the glorious Redeemer, to carry on the good work begun, and to make <i>New-England</i> the joy of the whole earth. I suppose you have heard, honoured Sir, of the remarkable effusion of the spirit among the children of the orphan-house. Surely, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    is about to bring mighty things to pass. Whilst the kings of the earth are enlarging their dominions, I trust our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will usher in his.—I shall not be surprized, if after this great commotion in <i>New-England</i>, I hear that some outward troubles befal them. The removal of you, honoured Sir, from being governor, I take to be no good sign. I hope this has no other effect upon your own heart, than to make you more and more hunger and thirst after that righteousness, which neither men nor devils shall ever be able to take from you. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows, how often I have prayed, that this affliction may be sanctified unto you. I think, honoured Sir, I cannot forget you and your
    <a id="p291"></a>people. Both are dear, very dear to my soul. I sometimes long to see <i>Boston</i> again, that I may rejoice in what great things the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has done; but various circumstances concur to detain me on this side the ocean, all the next Winter. I am now in my passage to <i>Scotland</i>. What the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased to do there, your honour may hear in my next. I rejoice, that I am a little retired from the world, and have the opportunity, honoured Sir, of writing to you. How sweet is retirement when <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is present in the heart? Having him, I find I possess all things. Happy they that can wrap themselves in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    May you and yours be thus happy! This will enable you, honoured Sir, to rejoice in tribulation, and give thanks for every thing that does befal you. Tho’ the ship is moving, and I am somewhat sick, I know not how to leave off. Indeed, I love and honour you in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    That you and yours may be rooted and grounded in his love, and filled with all the fulness of <span

    is beginning afresh. I have free access every where, and have been upon the full stretch preaching to large auditories twice a day, for some time past. The <span

    is pleased to strengthen me both in body and soul. His presence fills the assemblies, and, I verily believe, we shall yet see glorious days. I have sweet accounts from the Orphans. I thank you, dear Sir, for your care concerning them. I have been in great straits; but the dear <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    helps me through them all. Help me, dear Sir, help me to praise him. My tender love awaits both you and your people. I am glad to hear, that my kind hostess is recovered. May the <span

    may effectually work upon your heart betimes, for you cannot be good too soon, or too good. The little orphans at <i>Georgia</i> are crying out, “What shall we do to be saved?” And I am glad to hear, that this is the language of some little ones in <i>New-England</i>. If you know any of them, pray give my love to them, and tell them, I pray that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    may be revealed in their dear hearts. How early was <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    in the Temple, first hearing, and then asking questions? How did he love the little children, how did he take them up in his sacred arms and bless
    <a id="p293"></a>them; and when he was just ascending to the highest heaven, how tenderly did he speak to <i>Peter</i>, and bid him “feed his lambs.” Let all this encourage you to come unto him. He will certainly receive you, tho’ you have been wicked; nay, he will abundantly pardon you. And what comfort will you enjoy, when you know your sins are forgiven you? You will then have a heaven upon earth. In expectation of seeing you a christian indeed, and grown in grace, I subscribe myself</p>

    is a precious Master. He, as it were, dandles me upon his knees. He carries me in his arms, he fights all my battles, and makes me more than conqueror thro’ his love. My work is great, but my supports are greater. He assures me from day to day, that he will never leave me nor forsake me. My infirmities often make me blush, and yet <span

    passes them all by. Dear Sir, think often on the love of <span

    <i>Dear Gentlemen</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH unspeakable pleasure have I heard, that there seems to be a general concern among you about the things of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    It was no small grief to me, that I was obliged to say of your college, that “your light was become darkness;” yet are ye now become light in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>. I heartily thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    even the Father of our glorious Redeemer, for sending dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>
    among you. What great things may we not now expect to see in <i>New-England</i>, since it has pleased <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to work so remarkably among the sons of the prophets? Now we may expect a reformation indeed, since it is beginning at the house of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    A dead ministry will always make a dead people. Whereas, if ministers are warmed with the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    themselves, they cannot but be instruments of diffusing that love among others. This, this is the best preparation for the work whereunto you are to be called. Learning without piety, will only make you more capable of promoting the kingdom of satan. Henceforward, therefore, I hope you will enter into your studies not to get a parish, nor to be polite preachers, but to be great saints. This, indeed, is the most compendious way to true learning: for an understanding enlightened by the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    is more susceptible of divine truths, and I am certain will prove most useful to mankind. The more holy you are, the more will <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    delight to honour you. He loves to make use of instruments, which are like himself. I hope the <i>good old divinity</i> will now be precious to your souls, and you will think it an honour to tread in the steps of your pious forefathers. They were acquainted with their own hearts.—They knew what it was to be tempted themselves, and therefore from their own experience knew how to succour others. O may you follow them, as they followed <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Then great, very great will be your reward in heaven. I am sure you can never serve a better Master than <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    or be engaged in a higher employ than in calling home souls to him. I trust, dear gentlemen, you will
    <a id="p297"></a>not be offended at me for sending you these few lines. I write out of the fulness of my heart. I make mention of you always in my prayers. Forget me not in yours. I am a poor weak worm. I am the chief of sinners, and yet, O stupendous love! the <span

    did not convert <i>Richard W――</i>, he would be one of the most unhappy boys in the world. You have <i>head-knowledge</i>; and unless you are made to see the sinfulness of your heart, it will much increase your condemnation. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who yet hath patience with you, and seems to be striving with your soul. I do not wonder that the
    <a id="p301"></a>devil tells you, “it is time to repent when you are a man.” You may well say, it is the devil that tells you so: Such a suggestion cannot come from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Behold, now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation! <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will even now accept you, vile as you are, and ungrateful as you have been: if you feel your misery, and fly to him for succour, he will accept you. Every conviction cries, “Come, <i>Richard</i>, come to me, that thou mayest have rest.” Let me advise you, as old <i>Eli</i> advised young <i>Samuel</i>: say, “Speak, <span

You cannot conceive what a mystery of iniquity is hid therein. The more you see it, the more you will find the want of a saviour, and adore <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for giving his dear Son to die for sinners. There was once a young man, named <i>John</i>, who leaned on the Saviour’s bosom, and was his particular favourite. What if you should be thus highly honoured. Would it not be an amazing instance of love and condescension? And what doth the Saviour do less, for all that feel themselves poor, lost, undone sinners? Nay, does he not do for them infinitely more? Yes, he does. Come to him, therefore, by faith, and he shall embrace you in the arms of his mercy, clothe you with his righteousness, sanctify you by his spirit, guide you by his counsel, and after death receive you up into glory. Look up, then, and never rest till you have it. Conviction is not conversion. But you know who has promised not to quench the smoaking flax, or break the bruised reed.

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was very gracious to me on board. He gave us a pleasant passage. As you know that the <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr> <i>Erskines</i>
    gave me the first invitation to <i>Scotland</i>, and hath been praying for me in the most public, explicit, I could almost say extravagant manner, for near two years last past, I was determined to give them the first offer of my poor ministrations. Accordingly, I went yesterday to <i>Dumfermling</i>, where dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R―― E――</i>
    hath got a large and separate, or, as it is commonly termed, seceding meeting-house. He received me very lovingly. I preached to his and the town’s
    <a id="p305"></a>people.—A very thronged assembly—After I had done prayer, and named my text, the rustling made by opening the bibles all at once, quite surprized me: a scene, I never was witness to before. Our conversation after sermon, in the house, was such as became the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    They entertained me with various accounts of the success of the <i>Seceders</i> labours; and, as a proof of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s being with them, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R――</i>’s
    son-in-law told me, that, at one of their late occasions, a woman was so deeply affected, that she was obliged to stop her mouth with an handkerchief to keep herself from crying out. They urged a longer stay, in order to converse more closely, and to set me right about church government, and the solemn league and covenant. I informed them, that I had given notice of preaching at <i>Edinburgh</i> this evening; but, as they desired it, I would in a few days return, and meet the associate presbytery in <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R――</i>’s
    house. This was agreed on. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>E――</i>
    accompanied me, and this evening I preached to many thousands, in a place called <i>The Orphan-house Park</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was there. Immediately after sermon, a large company, among whom were some of the nobility, came to salute me. Amidst our conversation, came in a portly, well-looking Quaker, nephew to <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr> <i>E――</i>,
    formerly a Baptist minister in the north of <i>England</i>, who, taking me by the hand, said, “Friend <i>George</i>, I am as thou art; I am for bringing all to the life and power of the everliving <span
      class="smcap">God</span>:
    and, therefore, if thou wilt not quarrel with me about my hat, I will not quarrel with thee about thy gown.” In this respect, I wish all, of every denomination, were thus minded. I find <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has blessed my works in these parts. I am most cordially received by many that love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    I have just been in company with a nobleman, who, I believe, truly fears <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    and also with a lady of fashion, that discovers a christian spirit indeed. I already hear of great divisions. But <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    knows how to bring order out of confusion. I hope the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is much with you, my dear brother. O may you be anointed more and more, till you are filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Be pleased to read this to all in <i>Wine-street</i>; and remember me kindly to all that love the glorious Redeemer. He is a dear, dear <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>. Tho’ we die for, yet

    am glad they intend to meet in a synod by themselves. Their catholic spirit will do good. The <i>associate presbytery</i> here, are so confined, that they will not so much as hear me preach, unless I only will join with them. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Ralph E――</i>,
    indeed, did hear me, and went up with me into the pulpit of the <i>Cannon-gate</i> church.—The people were ready to shout for joy; but, I believe, it gave offence to his associates. I met most of them, according to appointment, on <i>Wednesday</i> last.—A set of grave venerable men! They soon proposed to form themselves into a presbytery, and were proceeding to chuse a moderator—I asked them for what purpose? They answered, to discourse, and set me right, about the matter of church-government, and the solemn league and covenant. I replied, they might save themselves that trouble, for I had no scruples about it; and that settling church-government, and preaching about the solemn league and covenant, was not my plan; I then told them something of my experience, and how I was led out into my present way of acting. One in particular said, he was deeply affected; and the dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>E――</i>
    desired they would have patience with me, for that having been born and bred in <i>England</i>, and never studied the point, I could not be supposed to be so perfectly acquainted with the nature of their covenants. One, much warmer than the rest, immediately replied, “that no indulgence was to be shown me; that <i>England</i> had revolted most with respect to church government; and that I, born and educated there, could not but be acquainted with the matter now in debate.” I told him, I had never yet made the solemn league and covenant the object of my study, being too busy about matters, as I judged, of greater importance. Several replied, that every pin of the tabernacle was precious.—I said, that in every building there were outside and inside workmen; that the latter, at present, was my province; that if they
    <a id="p308"></a>thought themselves called to the former, they might proceed in their own way, and I should proceed in mine. I then asked them seriously, what they would have me to do; the answer was that I was not desired to subscribe immediately to the solemn league and covenant; but to preach only for them till I had further light. I asked, why only for them? <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Ralph E――</i>
    said, “they were the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    people.” I then asked, whether there were no other <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    people but themselves; and supposing all others were the devil’s people, they certainly had more need to be preached to, and therefore I was more and more determined to go out into the highways and hedges; and that if the Pope himself would lend me his pulpit, I would gladly proclaim the righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    therein. Soon after this, the company broke up; and one of these, otherwise venerable men, immediately went into the meeting-house, and preached upon these words, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night, if ye will enquire, enquire ye; return, come.” I attended; but the good man so spent himself in the former part of his sermon, in talking against prelacy, the common-prayer book, the surplice, the rose in the hat, and such like externals, that when he came to the latter part of his text, to invite poor sinners to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    his breath was so gone, that he could scarce be heard. What a pity that the last was not first, and the first last! The consequence of all this was, an open breach. I retired, I wept, I prayed, and after preaching in the fields, sat down and dined with them, and then took a final leave. At table a gentlewoman said, she had heard that I had told some people, that the associate presbytery were building a <i>Babel</i>. I said, “Madam, it is quite true; and I believe the <i>Babel</i> will soon fall down about their ears:” but enough of this. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    what is man, what the best of men? but men at the best! I think I have now seen an end of all perfection. Our brethren in <i>America</i>, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, have not so learned <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Be pleased to inform them of this letter. I have not time to write now. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    blesses my preaching here, and the work, I think, is begun afresh in <i>London</i>. I preach to many thousands daily, and several have applied to me already under convictions. I

On <i>Tuesday</i> I preached in the <i>Cannongate</i> church; on <i>Wednesday</i> and <i>Thursday</i> at <i>Dumfermling</i>; and at my return on <i>Friday</i> morning, at about eight o’clock, I preached at a town called <i>Queens-Ferry</i>, seven miles from <i>Edinburgh</i>. Every where the auditories were large, and very attentive. Great power accompanied the word. Many have been brought under convictions; and I have already received several invitations to different places, which, <span

    willing, I intend to comply with. At present I can say no more, but desire you to pray for, and expect soon to hear further from,</p>

Glory be to free grace! many are here brought under convictions. Unworthy as I am, the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> is pleased to clothe his word with power.
    <a id="p310"></a>I am amazed at his loving-kindness, and want heaven and earth to join with me in praising his holy Name. By your son I have sent some papers, and shall gladly receive any from you. I wish you would not trouble yourself or me in writing about the corruptions of the Church of <i>England</i>. I believe there is no church perfect under heaven; but, as <span

    by his providence, is pleased to send me forth simply to preach the gospel to all, I think there is no need of casting myself out. The divisions in <i>Scotland</i> are affecting, and undoubtedly they will occasion great searchings of heart. I pray <span

    to support us in a trying hour. I am not yet determined, when I shall come your way. I can only promise, it shall be the first opportunity, and that you shall be apprized of it some time before. In the mean time, be pleased to bear me upon your heart. I am a weak helpless worm. Your correspondence will always be agreeable to me. That you may daily receive fresh anointings from above, is the hearty prayer of, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your kind letter, and heartily bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    if any thing dropping from my unworthy lips was made of service to your soul. I believe, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    inclined me to speak to you. The sons of the prophets are much upon my heart. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that you may be polished shafts, and noble instruments in his hands, of building up living temples for the Holy Ghost. The treatment I met with from the associate presbytery, was not altogether such as I expected. It grieved me, as much as it did you. I could scarce refrain from bursting into a flood of tears. I wish all were like-minded with your honoured father and uncle: matters then would not be carried on with so high an hand. I fear they are led too much. Such violent methods, such a narrow way of acting, can never be the way to promote and enlarge the kingdom of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    It surely must be wrong to fix such bounds to ourselves, as forbid even our hearing those who love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    in sincerity, and have also been owned of him. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    would not have done so.—Supposing the scheme of government which the associate presbytery contend for to be scriptural, yet forbearance and long-suffering is to be exercised towards such as may differ from them; and I am verily persuaded, there is no such form of government prescribed in the book of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    as excludes a toleration of all other forms whatsoever. Was the New Testament outward tabernacle to be built as punctual as the old, as punctual directions would have been given about the building it; whereas, it is only deduced by inference, and thus we see Independents, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians bring the same text to support their particular scheme, and I believe <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    thereby would teach us to exercise forbearance and long-suffering to each other. Was the associate presbytery scheme to take effect, out of conscience, if they acted consistently, they must restrain, and grieve, if not
    <a id="p315"></a>persecute many of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    children who could not possibly come into their measures; and I doubt not but their present violent methods, together with the corruptions of that assembly, will cause many to turn Independents, and set up particular churches of their own. This was the effect of archbishop <i>Laud</i>’s acting with so high an hand; and whether it be presbytery or episcopacy, if managed in the same manner, it will be productive of the same effects. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, I have not so learned <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I preach the simple gospel, and our glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is pleased to attend it with his power. Every day I feel more and more of the divine presence, and people are coming to me crying, “What shall we do to be saved.” The love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    fills my soul, and constrains me to write thus freely to you. O dear Sir, I love and honour your pious father. Remember me in the kindest manner to the good old man. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    his last days may not be employed too much in the non-essentials of religion. My heart is knit to the family. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    forbid, that any thing should hinder us from taking sweet counsel together. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I am to preach at <i>Falkirk</i> on <i>Tuesday</i> evening, and purpose to be at <i>Sterling</i> that night, and to preach twice there the next day. If it was thought advisable, I would collect for the Orphan-house at <i>Georgia</i> in the afternoon. The <span

    in whom alone I desire to glory. Congregations consist of many thousands. Never did I see so many bibles, nor people look into them, when I am expounding, with such attention.

Indeed, dear Sir, you mistake if you think I temporize on account of the orphans. Be it far from me. I abhor the very thought of it. I proceed now, just as I have done ever since I came out in the ministry; and so far from not setting a hedge about our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    garden, that was I called to it, I should set a much closer hedge than that which the associate presbytery are planting. I should enquire into people’s experiences, before I admitted them to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    table. I would have church members meet in church fellowship, and tell one another what <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has done for their souls. You seem to think I am not open to light. That I may give you satisfaction, I am willing

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have received two letters from you, which much affect me, knowing how unworthy I am of such endearing expressions, or indeed of any notice at all. But what shall I say? Grace! grace! <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    loves me, and so does his servant for <span
      class="smcap">Jesu</span>’s
    sake. O free grace! I am sorry to find that any should insinuate, my not coming to <i>Aberdeen</i> is owing to your cold invitation. Such a thought never entered my heart, but quite the contrary. The distance of the way, and my pressing call to <i>England</i>, will keep me from you, and nothing else. I love and honour you for my master’s sake. I should be glad to wash your feet, and if possible I will yet see you. But if <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    should not permit me, dear Sir, be not offended. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased to give me much freedom and power in preaching. Congregations are every where large, and they have been very liberal to my poor orphans. O that I was humble, and thankful! I am the chief of sinners: I feel myself such. O the efficacy of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    blood! It is omnipotent; it hath saved me. Dear Sir, my heart is melted down with the love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    He is a dear master. He hath suffered no evil to befal me, as you have already heard. I have not so much as hurt my foot against a stone. Help me to praise him. Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive all honour and glory and riches

    <i>My Lord</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH nature calls for rest, yet love and gratitude oblige me to sit up to answer your Lordship’s letter, lest I should not have time in the morning. Blessed be the glorious Redeemer! who seems in some degree to be working upon your heart. My prayer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is, that these convictions may continue, ’till they end in a sound conversion. You do well, my Lord, to fear, lest they should wear off. I have not had so much acquaintance with the world as your Lordship; but I know it is a deceitful thing, and without the utmost care and watchfulness, will insensibly divert the soul from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Your Lordship is in a dangerous situation. A fear of contempt, and a love for honour, falsely so called, render religion unfashionable
    <a id="p321"></a>amongst the rich and polite part of mankind. But the blood of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is almighty, and makes the soul more than conqueror. Here is the fountain to which you and I must apply, to wash away all our sins. And is it yet open for all poor sinners? Come then, my Lord, and lay yourself at the feet of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    He can, he will, if you believe on him, abundantly pardon you. But faith is the gift of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to give you no rest, ’till you have received the full assurance of faith. Then will you recover your primitive dignity, trample earth under your feet, and with your soul be panting after <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    O my Lord, it is a blessed thing to have fellowship with the Father, and with the Son. I am a poor despised minister of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>;
    but I would not change my Master for ten thousand worlds. I have food to eat, that the world knows nothing of. I long to have your Lordship taste of it too, and shall as it were travail in birth ’till <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    is formed in you. Your Lordship need not remind me to pray for you. Your eternal welfare is much upon my heart. My Lord, now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. The blessed spirit is now striving with you, and saying, “My son, give me thy heart; what hast thou to do any more with idols?” I hope your reply will be, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I give thee my heart, my whole heart, and will no longer keep back from thee the least part.” Then will your Lordship be truly happy; for so far as we are void of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    so far we are miserable. But whither am I running? It is late; but your Lordship desired a long letter, and therefore I have taken the liberty to write freely. I am sensible of the honour put upon me by your Lordship, and hope I shall never betray any trust reposed in me. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to sanctify this, and bless our fellowship when we meet together. I thank your Lordship for your concern about the orphans. I am persuaded you will in no wise lose your reward. I hope your Lordship received my last letter, which gave an account of my intended preaching at <i>Kinglassie</i> and <i>Coupar</i>. May the glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    sanctify my continuance in these parts, to the promoting his own glory and the good of souls! I think I can say, “to me to live is <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.”
    It revives me to see so many seeking after <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    At <i>Kinglassie</i> the power was extraordinary. O free grace! that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    should make use of such a wretch as I am. I desire to lie
    <a id="p322"></a>humbly in the dust, and say, “Why me, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    why me?” Fear not, my Lord, I have received remission of sins by the blood of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    Into his arms, I am just about to commend your Lordship. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to visit your soul with his salvation; and hoping my humble respects will find acceptance with your Lordship, your lady, and lady <i>Ann</i>, I beg leave to subscribe myself,</p>

    Supported with this thought, and feeling the power of it in my soul, I can despise all sublunary enjoyments, and long to be wholly swallowed up in <span

I cannot possibly stay with your Lordship all <i>Tuesday</i>, being to preach at <i>Dundee</i>. But in my return from <i>Aberdeen</i>, I hope to be at your Lordship’s house.

    I want a thousand tongues to set off the Redeemer’s praise. Having him, tho’ I have nothing else, I find I possess all things. I have not forgotten your Lordship since I wrote last. You are, and will be much upon my heart. I have heard of the piety of your Lordship’s ancestors, and hope many prayers are yet in store for you. Above all, I trust, <span

    prays for you, and then you cannot but be a conqueror; nay, more than conqueror over the world, the flesh and the devil. Take courage then, my Lord, and fear not to follow a crucified <span

    without the camp, bearing his sacred reproach. Beware of honour, falsely so called: dare to be singularly good, and be not ashamed of <span

    by faith, and your Lordship’s great possessions will not retard, but further and promote your progress in the divine life. What sweet communion will your Lordship then enjoy with <span

    in your walks and gardens? It will then be a little paradise to your soul, and every thing you meet with, will only draw you so much nearer to <i>Jehovah</i>, in whom all fulness dwells.

      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>

      class="smcap">God</span>
    is pleased to give me health, and to bless my ministrations in an abundant manner. The little children in the hospitals, are much wrought upon. Saints have been stirred up and edified, and many others, I believe, are translated from darkness to light, and from the kingdom of satan to the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    dear Son. The good that has been done, is inexpressible. I am intimate with three noblemen, and several ladies of quality, who have a great liking for the things of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I am now writing in an earl’s house, surrounded with fine furniture; but glory be to free grace! my soul is in love only with <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>:
    he helps me more and more. I feel but little straitness in preaching, and we have often sweet appearances of the divine presence in our large assemblies. As to my own soul, it is very comfortable and composed; I feel the power of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    more, and the power of indwelling sin less. I am daily waiting for the coming of the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I fear I am too impatient to be gone; but what can the soul do, when sick of love? I have some thoughts of visiting <i>Ireland</i>. Whether I shall do that, or come to <i>America</i> in the Spring,
    <a id="p325"></a><span class="smcap">God</span> only knows. I pray for, and long to see you and the rest of my dear family. I trust, I then shall behold, what I long to behold, a houshold of faith, a company of poor sinners walking in the simplicity and love of the meek and lowly <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    O that you may so live, that whosoever comes amongst you may say, “Surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is in this place.” Thousands of prayers are put up for us, and thousands of lies are spread abroad against us. But <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    enables me to fight my way through all, and I am persuaded he will make me more than conqueror through his love. In <i>England</i>, the work goes on well. Brother <i>C――</i> is much blessed in <i>Wiltshire</i>; and brother <i>H――</i> wrote me word some time ago, that he had examined about three hundred souls of our society, most of which had been wrought upon since my return from <i>Georgia</i>. Help me to cry, Grace! grace! My dear friend and brother, for the present adieu! I love you in the bowels of a crucified <span

    <i>Reverend and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>OME time past, I received a letter from your Presbytery of <i>Sutherland</i>, and if I mistake not, with your name subscribed. However, as I this night have seen your son, I think it my duty in a letter to you, to thank the reverend presbytery for their kind invitation; but as my stay in <i>Scotland</i> is so short, and <i>Sutherland</i> so far Northward, I cannot think of going thither at this time. Notwithstanding, my prayer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is, that the glorious gospel may flourish in your hands, and that you may bring many, very many souls to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    This, reverend Sir, unless my heart deceives me, is my only aim.</p>

    <a id="p327"></a>His grace is free. Dear Sir, help me to cry, Grace! grace! Surely I shall sing it in heaven. I long to be there, but am willing to tarry the <span

    <span class="dropcap">B</span>EING come thus far Northward, and hearing that you are this way, I cannot forbear writing, though nature calls for sleep. I was concerned I could not see you at <i>London</i>; but hope this will find you retired from a noisy world, and walking with your dear spouse as becometh the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    It is what I have longed and prayed for many a time. I am of the same mind as formerly. Nothing but <span

    can satisfy the soul. Aided by his Almighty power, I still go on through good report and evil report, preaching the gospel. Blessed be <span

    <i>My dear Sister</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS evening your letter came to hand. Though it is past eleven at night, and I have rode many miles this day, yet I cannot go to-bed without sending you a line. I fear, by your manner of writing, you are offended with me for my last letter. I knew very well, it would be a trial to you; but I wrote out of pure love, and am glad it is now in your power to clear your husband, which I much desired to do. I have too many aspersions of the same nature cast upon me, not to sympathize with you both. But <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is our advocate, and ere long we shall see all the accusers of the brethren cast down. In spite of all, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has been, and is getting himself the victory in many sinners hearts. I am yet carried on day by day, strengthened in body, and much refreshed and comforted in soul. Your letter gives me a little present pain, lest my last should have pained you. But <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    permits these things to happen among ourselves, to teach us to look off from all creatures, and to centre all our happiness in himself. Glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for his almighty love! At my first coming here, things looked a little gloomy; for the magistrates had been so prejudiced by one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    that when applied to, they refused me the use of the kirk-yard to preach in. This <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    is collegue with one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>O――</i>,
    at whose repeated invitation I came hither. Though collegues of the same congregation, they are very different in their natural tempers. The one is what they call in <i>Scotland</i>, of a <i>sweet blooded</i>, the other, of a choleric disposition. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    is neither a Seceder, nor quite a Kirk-man, having great fault to find with both. Soon after my arrival, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>O――</i>
    took me to pay my respects to him; he was prepared for it, and immediately pulled out a paper, containing a great number of insignificant queries, which I had neither time near inclination to answer. The next morning, it being <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>O――</i>’s
    turn, I lectured and preached; the magistrates were present. The congregation very large, and light and life fled all around. In the afternoon <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    officiated; I attended. He began his prayers
    <a id="p329"></a>as usual; but in the midst of them naming me by name, he intreated the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    to forgive the dishonour that had been put upon him, by my being suffered to preach in that pulpit; and that all might know what reason he had to put up such a petition, about the middle of his sermon, he not only urged that “I was a curate of the church of <i>England</i>,” but also quoted a passage or two out of my first printed sermons, which he said were grossly <i>Arminian</i>. Most of the congregation seemed surprized and chagrined, especially his good-natured collegue <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>O――</i>,
    who immediately after sermon, without consulting me in the least, stood up and gave notice, that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Whitefield</i>
    would preach in about half an hour. The interval being so short, the magistrates returned into the session’s-house, and the congregation patiently waited, big with expectation of hearing my resentment. At the time appointed, I went up, and took no other notice of the good man’s ill-timed zeal, than to observe in some part of my discourse, that if the good old gentleman had seen some of my later writings, wherein I had corrected several of my former mistakes, he would not have expressed himself in such strong terms. The people being thus diverted from controversy with man, were deeply impressed with what they heard from the word of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    All was hushed! and more than solemn! and on the morrow the magistrates sent for me, expressed themselves quite concerned at the treatment I had met with, and begg’d I would accept of the freedom of the city. But of this enough. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    my dear sister, my support; let us both continually fly to him, and then let men or devils do their worst. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    will by and by take away our reproach. Into his hands I commend your spirit. Good night; the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    be with you and yours! I hope to set out for <i>England</i> soon. Pray write when you hear of my arrival there, and so convince me, that you are not angry with</p>

    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Just snatch a few moments to answer your letter. Want of leisure prevented my doing it before. I have not as yet seen your mother’s memoirs. Happy are you in having such a parent. No doubt many prayers are in store for you. As for your entering upon the ministry, I cannot advise you, ’till you have gotten full satisfaction that you are born again of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I know more than one, who are ready to give up their ministry for want of this; and as for my own part, I could not feelingly press the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to others, unless I was sure of his love to myself. I know not what may have passed between <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and your soul. You can tell, I suppose, whether or not <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    spirit witnesseth with your spirit, that you are a child of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    For he that believeth, hath the witness in himself. If you have got this with a moderate share of learning, a good elocution and a burning love for precious souls, then, I think you may do service in a public station. If godly, and real experienced friends are for your entering into the ministry, their advice is somewhat to be regarded. If their advice proceeds from worldly motives, do not mind them at all. The discouragements you meet with from some, are not worth your notice. If <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    loves you, he will try you every way. Prayer, meditation, and temptation, are three necessary qualifications for a gospel minister. I know not what to say about your going to <i>Georgia</i>. In <i>Pensylvania</i>, and other places, there are most noble opportunities of preaching the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    But I hope to be in <i>Edinburgh</i> in about ten days, and then shall be glad to converse with you. In the mean time, dear Sir, I commend you to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and desire you would not forget the unworthy creature, who now subscribes himself</p>

The presence of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    accompanies me more and more. Wherever I have preached, I hear of the good fruits of it, both in convicting sinners, and reviving saints. At <i>Dundee</i>, the concern among the hearers is very remarkable. People are still more desirous to hear the word. But, <span

    <i>My Lord</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T is now past eleven at night; all is wrapt in awful silence. My soul is in a quiet composed frame. I have been giving your Lordship’s letter a second reading, with aspirations to <span
      class="smcap">God</span> whilst I perused it. Surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has not let me wrestle with him in vain. The Holy Spirit seems to be moving upon the face of your soul. I trust <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath said, “Let there be light,” and therefore there is light. O that the work may be carried on, till you enter into that rest which remains for the people of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I trust your Lordship will now awake into a new world, and know what it is to live by faith. Did I not know the power of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    blood, I should fear for you. But I commend you to a glorious Redeemer, that will certainly take care of you. As I left your Lordship’s house, I was thinking, that the narrow escape your Lordship had between the stones, foreboded something good. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has taken care of you when in your blood. I hope he is now passing by you, and saying unto you, “Live.” O that the stone of infidelity, which before lay at the door of your heart, may be now rolled away! O that you may rise, be loosed from your corruptions, and go about doing good! Satan will not let you go without much opposition. He will desire to have you, that he may sift you as wheat. But if <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    prays for you, all will be well. The comfort which you had with him in reading the psalms, is a taste of the food believers daily eat, and which the carnal world knows nothing of. My Lord, if you could be brought once to love secret prayer, and to converse feelingly with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in his word, your heaven will begin on earth; you will enjoy more pleasure than in all manner of riches. What will those avail, if you are not rich towards <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    Be, therefore, my Lord, much in secret retirement. Commune with your own heart in your chamber, and be still, and you will then hear the secret whispers of the Holy Ghost. As for praying in your family, I intreat you, my Lord, not to neglect it. You are bound to do it. Apply to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    for strength to overcome your present fears. They are the effects of pride, or infidelity, or of both. After once
    <a id="p336"></a>or twice, the difficulty will be over. O that the blessed Spirit may enable you to make intercession with groaning that cannot be uttered! It rejoices me to think, that I shall one day perhaps see a church in <i>Melvill</i> house. Happy, happy are you, my Lord, in having such a consort, who will forward your Lordship in every good word and work. How sweet will it be for you to go early to your devotions, striving to live like the first happy pair, before they had eaten the forbidden fruit. As <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    shall enable me, I shall bear you both upon my heart. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    forbid that I should sin against him in ceasing to pray for you. My riding upon your Lordship’s horse, will often remind me to pray for the donor. My Lord, you are upon my heart. Methinks I would undergo the pangs of the new birth for you; but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    can carry you through. Fear not. Go on in his strength, and your Lordship will be enabled to stand the shock of all. I should be glad to hear, from time to time, what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is doing for your soul. Since your Lordship has laid your commands upon me, I shall write as often as possible. If your Lordship is pleased to write within this week, a letter may be directed to me at <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>J――</i>’s,
    in <i>Abergavenny</i>. If afterwards, at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr. </abbr> <i>S――</i>’s,
    Grocer, in <i>Wine-street</i>, <i>Bristol</i>. Your Lordship may depend on my secresy; no one hath seen your Lordship’s letter, but <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>,
    who copies this, and who is as my own soul. His prayers, I trust, will benefit your Lordship. His humble respects await both you and your lady. Once more, I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to bless you both together. But it is late, the clock has struck twelve. Methinks I could wish the cry was now made, “Behold, the bridegroom cometh.” My soul longs to go forth to meet him. This evening I was greatly refreshed by preaching on these words, “This is my beloved, and this is my friend, oh daughters of <i>Jerusalem</i>.” O when shall I see him as he is! Well may your Lordship say, “He is altogether lovely.” The more you know him, the more you will have reason to commend him. Eternity is too short to utter all his praise. With a heart full of affection and thanks for all favours, I beg leave to subscribe myself, my Lord,</p>

    <i>My very dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>LTHOUGH it be past eleven at night, yet I cannot miss a post. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is doing very great things here. At <i>Dundee</i> the C―― was very extraordinary. On sabbath-day, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enabled me to preach four times, and to lecture in the evening at a private house. Yesterday I preached three times, and lectured at night. This day <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has enabled me to preach seven times. Once in the church, twice at the girl’s hospital, once in the park, once at the old people’s hospital, and afterwards twice in a private house. Notwithstanding, I am now as fresh as when I arose in the morning. “They that wait upon the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    shall renew their strength; they shall mount on wings like eagles.” It would delight your soul to see the effects of the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. Both in the church and park the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was with us. The girls in the hospital were exceedingly affected, and so were the standers-by. One of the mistresses told me, she is now awakened in the morning by the voice of prayer and praise; and the master of the boys says, that they meet together every night to sing and pray; and when he goes to their rooms at night to see if all be safe, he generally disturbs them at their devotions. The presence of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    at the old people’s hospital, was really very wonderful. The Holy Spirit seemed to come down like a mighty rushing wind. The mourning of the people, was like the weeping in the valley of <i>Hadadrimmon</i>. They appear more and more hungry. Every day I hear of some fresh good wrought by the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I scarce know how to leave <i>Scotland</i>. I believe I shall think it my duty to pay the inhabitants another visit as soon as possible. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    order my goings in his ways! Above five hundred pounds hath been collected, in money and goods, for the poor orphans. Let all that is within me praise <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s holy name. To-morrow, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall leave this place, and go through <i>Wales</i>, in my way to <i>London</i>. You may hear from me on the road. At present, I must conclude;
    <a id="p338"></a>it is very near twelve. I intreat you to pray and give thanks for, dear brother <i>C――</i>,</p>

    for the news which it contained. I yet expect to hear of, if not to see far greater things in <i>Scotland</i>. The <span

    has begun, and he will carry on a work, which shall make the ears of his enemies to tingle. I have enjoyed much of the divine presence since we parted. On <i>Saturday</i> I was

    to one who, I hope, will be a help meet to me. <span

    Be pleased to direct your next to <i>London</i>. I hope to be there in about three weeks. My wife I shall leave in the country for some time. Dear <abbr

    pray for us. I do for you and yours. Labour after an abiding of <span

    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>T length I have a little leisure. I must improve it, by writing a letter to your Ladyship. The many favours conferred on me, loudly called for a more speedy acknowledgment; but hitherto, business for my Master has prevented. Dear <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>C――</i>’s
    letter will inform your Ladyship that I have altered my state; I trust for the better; for I think my soul is more intimately united to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    than ever. I would humbly hope your Ladyship can say so too; for there is no happiness till we can feel an union of soul with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    That, and that only, as your Ladyship has often heard me assert, is true and undefiled religion. Your own experience will best convince you of the truth thereof. Your Ladyship enjoys great advantages, and glorious means of making progress in spiritual things. You are rich in this world’s goods; may <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    make you rich in faith and good works! My Master will not forget the kindness you have shewn to one of the least of his servants. It gives me comfort to think, what sweet freedom of spirit I have enjoyed, when opening the
    <a id="p340"></a>scriptures in your Ladyship’s house. Surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was with us of a truth. The savour of it is not yet gone off my own soul, nor, I hope, from your Ladyship’s also. Since I left <i>Edinburgh</i>, I have put up many hearty prayers for you and your family. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    make it an houshold of faith, and make you perfect, entire, lacking nothing! The glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> seems to be repairing the breaches of his tabernacle, which were fallen down. In <i>Wales</i> we had much of the divine presence. The people there are so hungry after the word, that they are resolved not to leave wrestling with the Most High, till he shall be pleased to send me thither. O that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may incline your Ladyship to intercede in my behalf! for I long to be humble, and to lie low as a very poor sinner at the Redeemer’s feet. I think I can say, he brings me nearer and nearer to himself daily; and I will not rest, till I am moulded into the image of my bleeding <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that your Ladyship may be content with no degrees of holiness; but may be daily pressing forward, till you arrive at the mark of the prize of the high calling in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    desires to join with me in sending our most affectionate respects and thanks to your Ladyship and all friends. Our particular respects await dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M<sup>c</sup>V――</i>.
    I trust he will yet live to see glorious days of the Son of Man. Surely <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is getting himself the victory. May he long reign king in your soul, and reward you a thousand-fold for every token of love shewn to, honoured Madam,</p>

    causes his goodness to pass before us. In a week I hope to set out for <i>London</i>. Be pleased to direct your next thither. The lords have returned my appeal. At present, a hook is put in the leviathan’s nose. “When a man’s ways please the <span

    No wonder, when we come to be thus minded, if carnal ministers, and carnal professors of all kinds, cry out against us. Nay, even some who have tasted that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is gracious, having slumbered and slept, and mixed too much with the world, even such frequently fight against their privileges, and rest in an infant state of piety. But, I believe, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will rouse them, and let the world know, what the blood of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    can and will do. Blessed be his name, we have a growing church at <i>Bristol</i>. Yesterday, and several other times, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath filled many as with new wine. Sometimes I scarce have known whether I have been in or out of the body; but, I find, the more I receive of grace, the more I desire to lie as a poor, very poor sinner at the feet of the wounded Lamb. Several have just now been with me, who have this last week, especially yesterday, drank deep of divine love. They are now full of the comforts of the Holy Ghost. I pray that they may walk humbly with their <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    for it is a good thing to know how to manage a manifestation aright: nature so frequently and artfully blends with grace, that, for want of a close watch and tender walk, we grieve the Holy Spirit. Hence arise deadness and darkness in the soul. Unbelief creeps in, the chariot wheels of divine love are taken off, and the soul drives heavily. Let us, therefore, my dear brother, live a life of great nearness to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>;
    and labour day by day to perfect holiness in the fear of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.

    <i>My very dear Friend and Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Came hither last <i>Friday</i>, and received a packet of letters from <i>Bethesda</i>; but wonder to find none from you. When I read brother <i>Grant</i>’s account of the circumstances of the family, I remember what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    pressed upon my soul on ship-board, “The bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast in those days.” However, be not discouraged; professor <i>F――</i>’s students were once obliged to sell their cloaths to buy candles. The work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    advances here greatly. We have a large society, consisting of several hundreds, and a noble place to meet in: I have called it a <i>Tabernacle</i>, because, perhaps, we may be called to move our tents. In <i>Wiltshire</i>, and at <i>Kingswood</i>, there are many good souls, and two new houses built. In <i>Wales</i> the door is opened wider than ever. From thence (<i>Abergavenny</i>) the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has given me a wife. Her name was <i>James</i>, a widow, between thirty and forty years of age. She has been a housekeeper many years. Once gay; but, for three years last past, a despised follower of the Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I left her about three weeks ago, and am going to-morrow to settle affairs, and to bring her up to <i>London</i>. I thank your dear wife for her letter: had I freedom I would answer it: but I have essayed several times before I could finish this. My sister <i>G――</i> is dead: I trust she slept in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is pleased to let me feel more of his power than ever. O that his whole mind was in me! I hunger and thirst after righteousness: blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    there is a promise that such shall be filled. By the letters sent with this, my dear family will see that I have not forgotten them. No: I pray for them continually. I cannot certainly tell when I shall leave <i>England</i>. Providence detains me here. The work is very extraordinary in <i>Scotland</i>. I hear daily accounts of its continuance and increase. The door is opened in all places. The Lords see through <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>’s
    enmity, and will have nothing to do with my appeal: so that a hook is put into the leviathan’s jaws. I believe we shall see
    <a id="p345"></a>greater things than ever. My dear friend, salute all most tenderly in my name; I am exceedingly engaged, or each of them should hear particularly from,</p>

    <i>Gloucester, <abbr

    <i>My Lord</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS comes to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s kind letter, dated <i>November <abbr
      title="ninth">9th</abbr></i>.
    Business has prevented my answering it sooner. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is yet pleased to deal bountifully with me. In <i>England</i>, as well as <i>Scotland</i>, the Redeemer is riding on from conquering to conquer. About Spring I hope to see <i>Scotland</i> again, and then, if possible, I will come as far as your Lordship’s house. I have lately been at <i>Bristol</i>, and <i>London</i>, and have had the pleasure of seeing the church walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghost. I have preached here twice every day, for some days last past. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    greatly countenances my administrations, and gives me constant peace and uninterrupted joy in believing. This is what, I trust, our glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> will confer upon your Lordship. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    wills that our joy should be full; but we entangle ourselves with the world, we indulge ourselves in sensual pleasures, we trifle away our time in what the world calls innocent diversions, and thereby we grieve the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and lose the comforts we should otherwise enjoy, from a close walk and communion with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Most complain of a deadness and leanness in their souls; what is it owing to? Not to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, but to ourselves. We leave <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, and then <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    leaves us. Not that we can keep ourselves by our own faithfulness; but notwithstanding, we must be faithful, and workers together with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I know not why I am led to write thus to your Lordship, but nothing else occurs to my mind at present. I am athirst for holiness myself, and long to see others athirst also. O my <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>!
    I see such beauty and transcendent excellencies in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    that I long to have his whole mind and image stamped upon my soul. Nothing can satisfy me, but the highest degrees of sanctification and inward
    <a id="p346"></a>holiness. Here, I believe, I am laudably ambitious. My Saviour wills my sanctification, my Saviour would have me filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. Even so <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span> come quickly! Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    humbly salutes your Lordship, and prays for your temporal and eternal welfare, with, my <span

    <span class="dropcap">L</span>AST <i>Thursday</i> evening the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    brought me hither. I preached immediately to our friends in a large barn, and had my master’s presence. On <i>Friday</i> and <i>Saturday</i> I preached again twice. Both the power, and the congregation increased. On <i>Sunday</i> <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    by a particular providence opened a door for my preaching in <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>John’s</i>,
    one of the parish churches. The late incumbent was my grand opposer. He being dead, and the new minister not having taken possession, the power of the pulpit was in the church-wardens hands. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    inclined them to let me preach there on <i>Sunday</i> morning, and yesterday afternoon. Great numbers came, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gave me unspeakable power. On <i>Sunday</i> afternoon, after I had preached twice at <i>Gloucester</i>, I preached at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>F――</i>’s
    at the hill, six miles off and again at night at <i>Stroud</i>. The people seem to be more hungry than ever, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    to be more amongst them. Yesterday morning I preached at <i>Painswick</i> in the parish church, here in the afternoon, and again at night in the barn. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gives me unspeakable comfort, and uninterrupted joy. Here seems to be a new awakening, and a revival of the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I find, several country people were awakened when I preached at <i>Tewksbury</i>, and have heard of three or four that have died in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>, who were called under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    by me. We shall never know what good field-preaching has done, till we come to judgment. Many who were prejudiced against me, begin to be
    <a id="p347"></a>of another mind, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    shews me more and more, “that when a man’s ways please the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    he will make even his enemies to be at peace with him.” To-morrow morning I purpose to set out for <i>Abergavenny</i>, and to preach at <i>Bristol</i>, in <i>Wilts</i>, <i>Gloucester</i>, and <i>Gloucestershire</i>, before I see <i>London</i>. The people in these parts seem excellently well disposed. I hope the work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    prospers in your hand; though absent in body, I am present with you in spirit. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    <i>Jehovah</i> comfort you continually with those comforts wherewith I am comforted in him! I hope my comforts are of a right nature; they humble at the same time that they exalt me. I find all my happiness lies in a crucified <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    forbid, therefore, that you or I should henceforth glory, save in the cross of <span

    It will be more honour to be a suffering servant of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    than to be the king’s commissioner. Your Lordship will pardon this freedom. Methinks I hear you say, “There is no comparison.” Indeed there is none. I would not change my post for ten thousand kingdoms. Blessed be <span

    that has given you a distant view of the emptiness of all things here below, and the insufficiency of every thing to make us happy besides <span

    May these things be realized, and stamped upon your Lordship’s heart! Then what a happy creature will your Lordship be? How will it rejoice me to see your Lordship next Spring. I know not but my friends prayers may draw me there, about that time. In the mean while, I pray <span

    from time to time to grant you a growth of grace, that you may know what it is to abide in <span

    make her a wise virgin! For her encouragement, I have sent an extract of a letter lately sent to me by a friend in <i>London</i>; and that your Lordship may know how it is with me, I have sent a copy of a letter I wrote to that friend a day or two ago. Last night I came hither, and preached this afternoon. I purpose shortly to go to <i>Gloucester</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, <i>Wiltshire</i>, and so to <i>London</i>. The church there as well as elsewhere flourishes. The time for favouring <i>Zion</i>, I believe, is indeed come. You see, my Lord, how long my letters are, when I have freedom and leisure. I have thought several times to write to your Lordship, but was restrained till I received your Lordship’s letter this morning. Be pleased to direct your next to be left with <abbr

  <p class="align_rt padr_10 secthdbrk">
    <i>Bristol, <abbr

    <i>Dear <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> M――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">B</span>OTH my wife and I received your letters. I send this, to thank you for them. I came from <i>Abergavenny</i> on <i>Saturday</i> night. My dear wife was pretty well; I expect her here on <i>Friday</i>. We shall bring no more goods to <i>London</i>, than we shall use; but I know not what to say about coming to your house, for brother <i>S――</i> tells me, you and your family are dilatory, and that you do not rise sometimes till nine or ten in the morning. This, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>,
    will never do for me; and I am persuaded such a conduct tends much to the dishonour of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and to the prejudice of your own precious soul. Sometimes I have looked upon you with grief; you have busied yourself about the outward affairs of religion in respect to others, and all the while I fear neglected to look into, and study the improvement of your own heart. I think you go backwards instead of forwards. I fear your present business will not answer, and I am sure you will have no solid comfort, till you look less abroad and more at home. Somebody said, you was like the <i>Athenians</i>, who desired to
    <a id="p353"></a>hear some new-thing. I thought the observation was too just. You are jealous about principles, (which is right) but all the while your own practice is not sufficiently watched over. I have heard that you spend much time in coffee-houses, and from your own house. I hope these things are not so; and it is with grief and out of tender love that I now mention them to you. For some time I felt my heart quite locked up from writing to you. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>
    will not be offended with me for this plain dealing. You know I love you, and I am sure this letter proceeds from love. I know too much of my own weakness and infirmities to insult others; and when a brother is overtaken in a fault, I desire to restore him in the spirit of meekness. But I know how much the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is concerned in our walk. The eyes of the world are now in an especial manner upon you. How holy ought you and I, dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>,
    to be, in all manner of conversation and godliness! Labour therefore, my dear brother, to get an abiding presence of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in your heart. Be willing to be searched. Pray that you may feel the full power of the Redeemer’s blood; and walk in the continued comforts of the holy ghost. Be not slothful in business. Go to bed seasonably, and rise early. Redeem your precious time: pick up the fragments of it, that not one moment may be lost. Be much in secret prayer. Converse less with man, and more with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Accept this advice, given in great love. I purpose staying here about a fortnight. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>, I am</p>

I have been carried as on eagles wings, and am now better in health than perhaps ever since I have been in the ministry. I preach here twice daily. In about a fortnight, I shall remove to <i>London</i>, where I purpose to continue, <span

    will give it to me. I am resolved never to rest, ’till self-love, bigotry, prejudice, and all narrowness of spirit be expelled out of my soul. Blessed be the Redeemer’s free grace!

    sake, strive to enter in at the straight gate, and never cease striving ’till you enter into that rest which awaits the people of <span

    in the heart, to be able to say, “My fellowship is with the Father and the Son.” It is true we are not to live, or rely on our frames. The righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    alone, and not our doings or sufferings, can recommend us to the Father. But however, we ought always to labour to be in a sweet and humble frame, and be watchful against any thing whatever, that may interrupt our communion with <span

    Peace and joy should flow in a believer’s soul, like a river. If any thing should obstruct the passage, he should not rest ’till faith overflows, and drives it away before him. I know not what others may say, but thro’ grace I can sing with bishop <i>Ken</i>,</p>

My dear brother, you see how free I write. Love constrains me to do so. O that I was a flame of fire! I have lately been at <i>Gloucester</i>. The <span

    was with us of a truth. In <i>Bristol</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

    may be my all in all. I pray <span

    that none of us may give in to narrowness of spirit, but look up to <span

    fill his soul with more of the disinterested love of <span

    providences as it were contradicting his promises. Thus it was with <i>Abraham</i> and <i>Jacob</i>, and thus I believe it is in some degree or other with all the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    for otherwise, how can faith be exercised? I doubt not but the enemy of souls will now be very busy with you, and break in with his fiery darts upon
    <a id="p360"></a>your soul; but I pray <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to keep you from staggering through unbelief. May you be strong in faith, giving glory to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    Against hope, may you believe in hope. However your husband may be disposed of, my prayer for you is, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>!
    make her still and resigned.” I think the love of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    constrains me to write you this letter. Who knows but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    may bless it to your soul? However, as you love the <span

    I hope you will receive it as a token of unfeigned christian sympathy and affection from, dear Sister,</p>

    prays for thee, and then the world shall not steal away thy heart from <span

    Satan hath been sifting me severely, these two or three days. I have had some close combats with the great dragon, but <span

    shall give it unto us. Dear
    <a id="p361"></a>brother <i>K――</i> has got the start of us. Happy man! He is at the end of his race. I sympathize with, and have been praying for his surviving friends. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enable us all to walk so circumspectly, that the common enemy may not have an occasion to speak reproachfully of us. But whither am I running? Excuse me, dear <i>Peter</i>. <span

    gives me freedom in writing to, and praying for you. I hope dear brother <i>R――</i> received my last in good part. <span

    passover; on <i>Thursday</i> we had a sweet love-feast; on <i>Friday</i> the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was with me twice at <i>Tockington</i>; on <i>Saturday</i> morning I broke up some fallow ground at <i>Newport</i>, by preaching with power to about two thousand people, and in the evening to many thousands at <i>Stroud</i> with wonderous power; on <i>Monday</i> morning at <i>Painswick</i>, and ever since twice a day here. Our congregations I think are larger than at <i>Bristol</i>. The word proves sharper than a two-edged sword. Every sermon is blessed. These words follow, “I have much people in this city.” I am just now going to <i>Chafford</i>. To-morrow I expect my wife. In my next, I will send you word what I intend to do. I was one day at <i>Bath</i>. I should be glad to see brother <i>R――</i>’s defence before it be published. I told him of it; I believe he will be upon his guard. His soul prospers. Sinless perfection I fear will be propagated in these parts. The <span

    <i>Reverend and dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have longed for some time to send you a line, and have wondered that I have heard no oftener from you; but as I know my own circumstances, I can the more easily guess how it is with you. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been very good to me since my arrival. I found when I came at first, I had all my work to begin again. Brother <i>W――</i> had so prejudiced the people against me, that those who were my spiritual children would not so much as come and see me; nay they have gone by me whilst preaching in <i>Moor-fields</i>, and stopped their ears. This I find in some measure hath been your case, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    wisely permits this, to teach us to cease from man. <i>Paul</i>’s Epistles to the <i>Galatians</i> much comforted me. Besides, I was embarrassed with brother <i>Seward</i>’s death. He died without making any provision for me, and I was at the same time much indebted for the Orphan-house.—But all this was to humble and prepare me for future blessings. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath enabled me, blessed be his name, to keep steady to my principles and usual practice. A new and numerous church has been raised at <i>London</i>. In <i>Essex</i>, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was wonderfully with me. Every where the congregations increase. In <i>Bristol</i> <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    enabled me to fight my way through. We have hired a large hall, and have expounded there twice a day. In <i>Scotland</i>, the work, for its beginning, is rather greater than at <i>New-England</i>. I hear continually of the seed sown increasing, and springing up. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose paying <i>Scotland</i> another visit. I have lately been at <i>Bristol</i>, and both there, and here, and also at <i>London</i>, the word runs and is glorified. Through the tender mercies of our <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I have been carried as on eagles wings through a variety of outward and inward trials. The greatness
    <a id="p363"></a>of which none knows but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and my own soul. About eleven weeks ago I married, in the fear of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    one who was a widow, of about thirty-six years of age, and has been a housekeeper for many years; neither rich in fortune, nor beautiful as to her person, but, I believe, a true child of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and would not, I think, attempt to hinder me in his work for the world. In that respect, I am just the same as before marriage. I hope <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will never suffer me to say, “I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.” I am glad that matters are settling so amicably at <i>Philadelphia</i>. What a pity is it, that we should fall out in the way to heaven! I would do any thing except defiling my conscience, and giving up what I think is truth, to prevent it. The associate brethren are much to be blamed; I never met with such narrow spirits. I do not forget you, or your brethren, or the churches in your parts. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    be with you. He is pleased to shew me more and more of my own heart, and day by day refreshes my soul. My body is weak as usual; but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is my strength. Help me to praise him. Pray send a line to, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    who hath brought you out of darkness into his marvellous light. I hope the Redeemer hath now shewn you his hands and his feet, and you can now say, “My <span

    and daily to aspire after the whole mind that was in <span

      class="smcap">God</span>:”
    and yet to such only is the promised blessedness, of being filled, given. As for my own part, I am ashamed to think how unlike I am to my Saviour; I see such beauty in him, that I long to be conformed to his divine image and likeness. May you and I, dear <abbr

    it is a blessed thing, dear Sir, to be brought out of self. It will be continually creeping in: happy they who have power over it. I do not wonder at your being united with <abbr

    the work in our hands every where increases. I am supported and encouraged, quickened and comforted day by day. <span

    loves and blesses me. May he bless you and yours more and more, and cause you to walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghost. My tender love to all. I hope yet to see you once more in the flesh. In the mean while I beg leave to subscribe myself, dear Sir,</p>

    He is our pattern; and if we have true grace in our hearts, we shall be continually labouring to copy after our great exemplar. O the life of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>!
    How little of it is to be seen in those that call themselves his followers. Humility, meekness, love, peace, joy, goodness, faith, and the other blessed fruits of the Spirit, whither are they fled? I fear most

    should be of that unhappy number. Dear Sir, there is an unspeakable fulness, unsearchable riches in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Out of him we are to receive grace for grace. Every grace that was in the Redeemer, is to be transcribed and copied into our hearts. This is Christianity; and without this, though we could dispute with the utmost clearness, and talk like angels, of the doctrines of grace, it would profit us nothing. To prevent the growth of this inward life, I am persuaded satan introduces heresies in the church, hoping thereby to stir up strife, envy, prejudice, and narrowness of spirit; and where these are, there will be every evil work. To this end, <i>sinless perfection</i> hath been propagated in <i>England</i>, and <i>Antinomian principles</i> suffered to be spread among you. But, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    both in <i>England</i>, and with you, I trust disputations and distractions are abated, and love and unity once more are lifting up their heads. This, at present, is the language of my heart:</p>

    “Love is of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in <span

    what shall I say more. The blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has been superabundantly good to my soul since my arrival. I have been carried, though through much weakness, as on eagles wings. In <i>England</i>, <i>Wales</i>, and <i>Scotland</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath blessed my poor labours more than ever. The calls to divers places, are loud and importunate; and, as <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has raised up many labourers among you, I think it my duty to stay here some time longer, and to visit <i>Scotland</i> once more. However, my friends abroad are continually upon my heart. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span> for you night and day. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    fill you with all his fulness! I desire to be remembered
    <a id="p368"></a>to all mentioned in your’s, and to all that love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    I love you unfeignedly, and entreat you to write again to, dear Sir,</p>
  <p class="blk_90 align_ctr">

    one of my close correspondents, I sit down this evening to write an answer to your kind letter. What has been doing lately, the transcript on the other side will shew you. Since the writing of that, the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath been wondrous kind. Yesterday I preached three times, and visited a private society in the evening. To-day I was enabled to preach three times, with great power. Here is such an awakening in this country, as I never heard of, or saw in these parts before: “The fields are white already unto harvest.” It is pleasant to hear the people come and tell how <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    wrought upon them by my unworthy ministry two years ago. The fruits of the Spirit are now apparent in their lives and conversations. Letters from <i>Scotland</i> bring blessed tidings, as also from <i>Philadelphia</i>. O the blessed effects of field-preaching! O that I was humble, that I was thankful! Help me, my dear friend, to entreat the Redeemer to make me as a little, <i>a very little child</i>. The beginning of next week I hope to be at <i>Bath</i>; but cannot tell exactly the day. I thank my friends for their kind intention to meet me, but I had rather avoid it: the less parade the better. Let us stand still, and we shall see the salvation of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    He will not bless what doth not come from himself. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    make me an <i>Israelite</i> indeed, in whom is no allowed guile! I am glad dear <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Am now upon the road to <i>London</i>. This morning your acceptable letter came to hand. Though somewhat wearied, I would fain answer it before I retire to rest. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    who causes your Ladyship to be never less alone, than when alone. O Madam, what a comforter is the Holy Ghost? What sweet company is <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>?
    What a privilege is it to have fellowship with the great Three-One? A world lying in wickedness knows nothing of it. Every thing yields comfort when the blessed Spirit breathes upon it. Even this scribble, from the chief of sinners, from one who is less than the least of all saints, shall again refresh your soul, if <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    speaks the word. Amazed am I, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span> should work by my hands. But <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is love. He yet delights to honour me. I have lately seen the Redeemer riding in his strength, and getting himself the victory in poor sinners hearts. Letters from abroad inform me of the same. O that our glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    may set the world in a flame of love! Hasten that time, O blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>:
    O let thy kingdom come! I have heard from my dear Orphans to-day. They have been reduced to straits; but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath stirred up a wealthy friend or two to assist them. The everlasting <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    reward all their benefactors! I find there has been a fresh awakening
    <a id="p371"></a>among them. I am informed, that twelve negroes, belonging to a planter lately converted at the Orphan-house, are savingly brought home to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    This will rejoice your Ladyship’s heart. I am glad to hear that the work goes on in <i>Scotland</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I trust, will ripen your soul apace for glory. He hath various ways of perfecting his saints. Methinks I see your Ladyship sitting in your chair, and ravished with the Redeemer’s beauty day by day. Sometimes you are as it were washing his feet with your tears; at other times sitting by faith at his feet, and hearing or reading his word. Sometimes your heart is too big to speak; then again, out of the abundance of your heart, your mouth poureth forth hallelujahs. Sometimes you are lost in wonder; at all times longing to be dissolved and to be with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>;
    for, when you hear him say, “Rise up, my love, and come away,”</p>
  <div class="quotectn txt_sm">

    <i>My very dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have herewith sent you a parcel. Be pleased to read the letters, and send them as directed. I received your kind letter, dated in <i>December</i>, and thank you for all kindnesses shewn to the poor orphans. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    will richly reward you. Before yours came, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    had given me an enlarged heart, and unfeigned love and freedom to converse with all his dear children, of whatever denomination. I talk freely with the <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr> <i>W――</i>’s,
    though we widely differ in a certain point. Most talk of a catholic spirit; but it is only till they have brought people into the pale of their own church. This is downright sectarianism, not catholicism. How can I act consistently, unless I receive and love all the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    whom I esteem to be such, of whatever denomination they may be? Why should we dispute when there is no probability of convincing? I think this is not giving up the faith, but fulfilling our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    new command, “Love one another:” and our love is but feigned, unless it produces proper effects. I am persuaded, the more the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is shed abroad in our hearts, the more all narrowness of spirit will subside and give way: besides, so far as we are narrow spirited, we are uneasy. Prejudices, jealousies, and suspicions make the soul miserable, so far as they are entertained. But enough of this: my dear brother <i>N――</i> is of my mind. Only let me give you one caution: Take heed that your getting acquainted with any new set of Christians, does not lead you insensibly to despise others of your old acquaintance. Watch, and deal very tenderly with all; otherwise you will grow reserved and artful, and lose a simple, open, guileless, <i>Israelitish</i> spirit, before you are aware. There needs a close adherence to the motions of the Holy Spirit, and a constant watching over the corruptions of our own hearts, in order that we may walk before <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    as very little children. O that I was a little child indeed! <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    can make me one. My dear brother, I thank you for your kind invitation. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    <a id="p373"></a>willing, I shall accept it, if ever I see <i>New-York</i>. But I think Providence calls me once more to <i>Scotland</i>. I have been lately plowing up some fallow ground, and now preach twice every day. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    does indeed bless the word, and gives me to rejoice in the felicity of his chosen. Be so kind now and then to drop a line to my dear orphan-family. As opportunity offers, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gives freedom, you shall hear from, dear brother <i>N――</i>,</p>

    who was so kind as to come and see me last night, I trust is coming on. I hope both you and him will experience a solid establishment in the grace of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>.
    There is no rest here, no true solid lasting rest, till we come to this. Our hearts are deceitful above all things. We seek rest in outward things. We change our places, circumstances, and stations;—but if <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    loves us, he will put a thorn in the place where we would fain nestle. A soul that has had some awakenings, and been wandring from <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    is like <i>Noah</i>’s dove which could find no rest for the sole of its foot, till it came back to the ark again. This ark is <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and when we are safely locked in there, and the soul hath received an abiding witness, then out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. This is the reason why <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    bid his disciples to wait for the promise of the Father. Filled with this, the woman of <i>Samaria</i> could not but call on others to come and see. And were we but animated, led and influenced by this spirit, what a blessed union would there be among all the churches of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>?
    It is a want of more of this, that now at present disunites us. I despair therefore of a greater union, till a greater measure of the spirit be poured from on high. Hence, therefore, I am resolved simply to preach the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and leave others to quarrel by and with themselves. To contend, where there is no probability of convincing, only feeds and adds fuel to an unhallow’d fire, which a misguided zeal kindles in the heart. Love, forbearance, long-suffering, and frequent prayer to your dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    is the best way to extinguish and put it out. O love, true, simple, christian, undissembled love, whither art thou fled! The language of my heart is,—But whither am I going? You see, my friend, how freely I write. The blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    warms and fills me, whilst I am writing. I know, though I am unworthy, you will send me a line in return. Methinks I could wash your feet. Methinks, I long to see your shackles drop off, and your soul free for the uninterrupted service of the best of masters. Faith in his bloody wounds is the only means. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    evermore give my dear friend and his wife living faith, which may purify their hearts, enable them to overcome the world, and will
    <a id="p377"></a>work by love! The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    make you both as little children before him! This is the prayer of, dear <abbr

    give you grace to feed them, that they may grow in grace as they grow in years, and make perpetual advances in the knowledge of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Be pleased to salute them from me, in the kindest manner. Entreat them, O exhort them to remember their Creator in the days of their youth, and to keep close by his wounded side. Tell them, dear Sir, from time to time, of the power and efficacy of his all-atoning blood: it purifies the heart, overcomes the world, and fills the believer with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Watch over their dear souls day by day, and wait closely upon the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    yourself, that you may be taught of him to feed his lambs. It is a work of the utmost importance. No less than infinite wisdom can be sufficient for you; but if any man lack wisdom, let him ask it from above; <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    giveth liberally to the lovers of his dear Son, and upbraideth not. Dear Sir, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is love. He hath loved me, and is pleased to work by me more and more. At home, and abroad, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    rides on gloriously. I hope, at my return to <i>Scotland</i>, to see greater things than ever. When it shall be, I know not yet. <span

    I do not preach in vain. The accounts from <i>New-England</i>, <i>Scotland</i>, and <i>Carolina</i>, are surprizing. In <i>London</i>, the word of the <span

    runs and is glorified. Every day we see the Redeemer’s stately steps. I have not time, dear Sir, to tell you what great things our great master is doing for his people, and yet I believe we shall see greater things than these. From <i>Georgia</i> also, I have great accounts. The spirit of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath been breathing upon the orphans. I thank you, dear Sir, for your intended benefaction, and kind invitation. If ever our dear <span

    calls me your way, I shall accept it: though I am utterly unworthy to come under any one’s roof, but more especially that <span

    should come under the roof of the house of my soul.—But <span

    You look backward, instead of forward. You look into yourself, instead of looking up to Him, who is mighty and willing to save. O that you may have strength to go to him just as you are! You would then be delivered from your bondage. The case of the poor <i>Syrophœnician</i> woman may give you comfort. How did the Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    seem as it were to turn lion? How did he seem to turn a deaf ear to her complaints? And yet heard and loved her all the while. Why may not you believe? He will yet say to you, “Be it unto you even as thou wilt.” I fear some tell you, that it is well to doubt. Indeed they are mistaken. Dear Miss, expect great things from <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    “He is able to do abundantly for you above what you can ask or think.” His name, his nature is Love. Fear not; be not faithless, but believing. Wait, and you shall yet see the salvation of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. In <span

    will be now exceeding precious to your dear soul. What does he now require of you, but to walk humbly, closely, and with a child-like simplicity before him? He hath followed you, as well as prevented you with his mercies, and would suffer nothing to take you out of his hands. Satan hath desired you, satan has sifted you as wheat; but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    that friend of sinners, hath prayed for you, and therefore your faith hath not failed. The <span

      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    <i>thy servant heareth</i> now.”</p>
  <p>
    I doubt not but many will reproach you for your past backsliding, and question your future stability. Let all serve to humble you in the dust, and drive you to the loving <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    for refuge. “In him,” surely shall my dear friend say, “I have righteousness and strength.” Look up to him, and you shall be delivered from, nay, made more than conqueror over every temptation. He will fight your battles for you, and crown you when you have done. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>, the love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    now swallows up my soul. I see him more and more lovely every day. In <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    there is plenteous redemption. He came, that we might have life, nay that we might have it more abundantly. O what a blessing is it to be redeemed from a vain conversation, and from this present evil world. O that every poor sinner felt it! Then would his children agree in one, and divisions would be at an end. Blessed be our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    there is a greater prospect of union than ever. It is what my soul longs after, and labours for. It is a great pity that poor pilgrims should fall out in their way to heaven; but this will be, till we get more of the divine spirit. Pray we therefore for a great effusion of the Holy Ghost. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    <a id="p381"></a>we feel the Holy Ghost daily in our congregations. It surprizes me to see what a company of settled, solid christians are amongst us. The work goes on daily. This morning, how did <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    pierce and melt poor sinners hearts? Amazing accounts are brought from abroad.—Fresh awakenings in many places at home. Does not your soul long to tell sinners, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is Love. I am glad to hear you are so active. Go on in the strength of the triumphing Lamb. My heart is warm. Welcome home again, my dear friend, welcome to <span

    <i>London, May 11, 1742.</i></p>

    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH this, I send you a few out of the many notes I have received from persons, who were convicted, converted, or comforted in <i>Moorfields</i>, during the late holidays. For many weeks, I found my heart much pressed to determine to venture to preach there at this season, when, if ever, satan’s children keep up their annual rendezvous. I must inform you, that <i>Moorfields</i> is a large spacious place, given, as I have been told, by one <i>Madam Moore</i>, on purpose for all sorts of people to divert themselves in. For many years past, from one end to the other, booths of all kinds have been erected, for mountebanks, players, puppet shows, and such like. With a heart bleeding with compassion for so many thousands led captive by the devil at his will, on <i>Whit-Monday</i>, at six o’clock in the morning, attended by a large congregation of praying people, I ventured to lift up a standard amongst them in the name of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    of <i>Nazareth</i>. Perhaps there were about ten thousand in waiting, not for me, but for satan’s instruments to amuse them.—Glad was I to find, that I had for once as it were got the start of the devil. I mounted
    <a id="p385"></a>my field pulpit, almost all flocked immediately around it. I preached on these words, “As <i>Moses</i> lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so shall the son of man be lifted up, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>”
    They gazed, they listened, they wept; and I believe that many felt themselves stung with deep conviction for their past sins. All was hushed and solemn. Being thus encouraged, I ventured out again at noon; but what a scene! The fields, the whole fields seemed, in a bad sense of the word, all white, ready not for the Redeemer’s, but Beelzebub’s harvest. All his agents were in full motion, drummers, trumpeters, merry andrews, masters of puppet shows, exhibiters of wild beasts, players, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr> <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    all busy in entertaining their respective auditories. I suppose there could not be less than twenty or thirty thousand people. My pulpit was fixed on the opposite side, and immediately, to their great mortification, they found the number of their attendants sadly lessened. Judging that like saint <i>Paul</i>, I should now be called as it were to fight with beasts at <i>Ephesus</i>, I preached from these words: “Great is <i>Diana</i> of the <i>Ephesians</i>.” You may easily guess, that there was some noise among the craftsmen, and that I was honoured with having a few stones, dirt, rotten eggs, and pieces of dead cats thrown at me, whilst engaged in calling them from their favourite but lying vanities. My soul was indeed among lions; but far the greatest part of my congregation, which was very large, seemed for a while to be turned into lambs. This encouraged me to give notice, that I would preach again at six o’clock in the evening. I came, I saw, but what—thousands and thousands more than before if possible, still more deeply engaged in their unhappy diversions; but some thousands amongst them waiting as earnestly to hear the gospel. This satan could not brook. One of his choicest servants was exhibiting, trumpeting on a large stage; but as soon as the people saw me in my black robes and my pulpit, I think all to a man left him and ran to me. For a while I was enabled to lift up my voice like a trumpet, and many heard the joyful sound. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people kept praying, and the enemy’s agents made a kind of a roaring at some distance from our camp. At length they approached nearer, and the merry andrew, (attended by others, who complained that they had taken many pounds less that day on account of my preaching) got
    <a id="p386"></a>upon a man’s shoulders, and advancing near the pulpit attempted to slash me with a long heavy whip several times, but always with the violence of his motion tumbled down. Soon afterwards, they got a recruiting serjeant with his drum, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    to pass through the congregation. I gave the word of command, and ordered that way might be made for the king’s officer. The ranks opened, while all march’d quietly through, and then closed again. Finding those efforts to fail, a large body quite on the opposite side assembled together, and having got a large pole for their standard, advanced towards us with steady and formidable steps, till they came very near the skirts of our hearing, praying, and almost undaunted congregation. I saw, gave warning, and prayed to the captain of our salvation for present support and deliverance. He heard and answered; for just as they approached us with looks full of resentment, I know not by what accident, they quarrelled among themselves, threw down their staff and went their way, leaving however many of their company behind, who before we had done, I trust were brought over to join the besieged party. I think I continued in praying preaching and singing, (for the noise was too great at times to preach) about three hours. We then retired to the tabernacle, with my pockets full of notes from persons brought under concern, and read them amidst the praises and spiritual acclamations of thousands, who joined with the holy angels in rejoicing that so many sinners were snatched, in such an unexpected, unlikely place and manner, out of the very jaws of the devil. This was the beginning of the tabernacle society.—Three hundred and fifty awakened souls were received in one day, and I believe the number of notes exceeded a thousand; but I must have done, believing you want to retire to join in mutual praise and thanksgiving to <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and the Lamb, with</p>

    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">F</span>RESH matter of praise; bless ye the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    for he hath triumphed gloriously. The battle that was begun on <i>Monday</i>, was not quite over till <i>Wednesday</i> evening, though the scene of action was a little shifted. Being strongly invited, and a pulpit being prepared for me by an honest quaker, a coal merchant, I ventured on <i>Tuesday</i> evening to preach at <i>Mary le bon fields</i>, a place almost as much frequented by boxers, gamesters, and such like, as <i>Moor-fields</i>. A vast concourse was assembled together, and as soon as I got into the field pulpit, their countenance bespoke the enmity of their hearts against the preacher. I opened with these words—“I am not ashamed of the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>, for it is the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    unto salvation to every one that believeth.” I preached in great jeopardy; for the pulpit being high, and the supports not well fixed in the ground, it tottered every time I moved, and numbers of enemies strove to push my friends against the supporters, in order to throw me down. But the Redeemer stayed my soul on himself, therefore I was not much moved, unless with compassion for those to whom I was delivering my master’s message, which I had reason to think, by the strong impressions that were made, was welcome to many. But satan did not like thus to be attacked in his strong-holds, and I narrowly escaped with my life: for as I was passing from the pulpit to the coach, I felt my wig and hat to be almost off. I turned about, and observed a sword just touching my temples. A young rake, as I afterwards found, was determined to stab me, but a gentleman, seeing the sword thrusting near me, struck it up with his cane, and so the destined victim providentially escaped. Such an attempt excited abhorrence; the enraged multitude soon seized him, and had it not been for one of my friends, who received him into his house, he must have undergone a severe discipline. The next day, I renewed my attack in <i>Moor-fields</i>; but would you think it? after they found that pelting, noise, and threatnings would not do, one of the <i>merry Andrews</i> got up into a tree very near the pulpit,
    <a id="p388"></a>and shamefully exposed his nakedness before all the people. Such a beastly action quite abashed the serious part of my auditory; whilst hundreds of another stamp, instead of rising up to pull down the unhappy wretch, expressed their approbation by repeated laughs. I must own at first it gave me a shock; I thought satan had now almost outdone himself; but recovering my spirits, I appealed to all, since now they had such a spectacle before them, whether I had wronged human nature in saying, after pious <i>Bishop Hall</i>, “that man, when left to himself, is half a devil and half a beast;” or as the great <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Law</i>
    expressed himself, “a motley mixture of the beast and devil.”—Silence and attention being thus gained, I concluded with a warm exhortation, and closed our festival enterprizes, in reading fresh notes that were put up, praising and blessing <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    amidst thousands at the tabernacle, for what he had done for precious souls, and on account of the deliverances he had wrought out for me and his people. I could enlarge; but being about to embark in the <i>Mary and Ann</i>, for <i>Scotland</i>, I must hasten to subscribe myself,</p>

  <p class="align_rt">
    <i>G. W.</i></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <i>P. S.</i> I cannot help adding, that several little boys and girls who were fond of sitting round me on the pulpit, while I preached, and handing to me peoples notes, though they were often pelted with eggs, dirt, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    thrown at me, never once gave way: but on the contrary, every time I was struck, turned up their little weeping eyes, and seemed to wish they could receive the blows for me. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    make them in their growing years great and living martyrs for him, who out of the mouth of babes and sucklings perfects praise!</p>

    <i><abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your letter on <i>Saturday</i> last, and felt great concern on my soul, while perusing it. One thing especially pleased me; I found by the contents, that a report I had
    <a id="p389"></a>lately heard concerning you was false; for I had heard, that the bishop seeing your zeal, and finding his opposition had inflamed, at last had ordered the clergy to open the church doors for you, and that now you had done with appearing openly in the defence of the glorious Gospel. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    this is not true! Though I find, both you and your people have been greatly discouraged. I see no way of extricating yourself, but by acting up to the dictates of your own conscience, and leaving the consequences to the great head and king of the church. You find, dear Sir, a sensible withdrawing of the spirit ever since you gave way. It would not have been so, had you obeyed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    rather than man. Up then, and be doing, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will be yet with you. If you cannot preach freely in the <i>Isle of Man</i>, go whithersoever the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    shall be pleased to lead you. Our commission is very extensive: “Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” We want labourers much in <i>England</i>. If our ascended Saviour hath given you popular gifts, and freedom and authority in speaking without notes, you need not fear. He will assist you from time to time, and make you a blessing to many souls. Your being a minister of the established church, will be an advantage, and your age also will give you yet more authority; but an unction from the Holy One of <i>Israel</i> is the best qualification; I would therefore, dear Sir (if such a one as I, am capable of advising) by all means persuade you to humble yourself before the great bishop of your soul, and ask him again and again what he would have you to do? I am apt to think, he will not restore to you the comforts of the Holy Ghost, or stablish you with his free spirit, ’till you give up yourself simply to follow the dictates of his providence and spirit. Then let men or devils say or do their worst. How can we know <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    power unless we try it? Not that I would have you, dear friend, do any thing rashly. No, “he that believeth doth not make haste.” Wait upon the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and he will certainly shew you what he would have you to do. I wonder not that your brother’s love is grown cold. It is hard for one in his station, unless he be thoroughly inured to contempt, and will give <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    leave to act in his own way, to withstand a whole body of lukewarm, prejudiced, envious, malignant clergy. These, have always been the greatest opposers of true
    <a id="p390"></a>vital religion. These, were our Saviour’s most bitter enemies. These, will be ours also, if we come forth in his spirit, and preach by his power. But blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I can say by happy experience, our glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> will make us more than conquerors over them all. He hath continually fought my battles for me, and I am persuaded will do so to the end. Of late, I have seen more of his power and goodness than ever, and I trust we shall yet see greater things than these. I am now once more going to <i>Scotland</i>, and purpose (<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing) the latter end of the year to embark for <i>America</i>. Pray let me hear from you, and if possible let me have a personal interview. I hope this will reach you. In the next, be pleased to tell me how to direct, for I have forgotten. The <span

    be with you. I wish you abundant prosperity in the name of the exalted Redeemer, and am</p>

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter dated <i>May <abbr
      title="fifth">5th</abbr></i>
    was very agreeable to me. I think it savoured of a true Israelitish spirit, and therefore I find freedom to send you a plain and simple answer. Who <i>J―― H――</i> is, I cannot tell. If he was converted by my unworthy ministry, or others by his means, let our dear <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    have all the glory. I shall know who they are, at the great day. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    I know very well. I believe he is a good man, but am not enough acquainted with his proceedings, either wholly to commend or condemn them. Whether he preaches in public, or converses only in a private manner, I know not. This one thing I know, if he be sent of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I wish him prosperity. The answer which our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gave to those who forbad such as were casting out devils in his name, because they followed not with them, makes me particularly cautious, how I interrupt any one that seems to speak of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    with sincerity of heart. As for his speaking so little against the church of England, I cannot discommend him for that. I
    <a id="p391"></a>find it best to talk only of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>’s
    blood, and the power of his Redemption, and not dwell much on outward things or outward worship. When the woman of <i>Samaria</i> asked our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    “where men ought to worship,” he diverted the discourse from the outward to the inward worship. “The worship of the Father in spirit and in truth.” Some things may be wrong in the church of <i>England</i>, and in this mixed state we must never expect to see a perfect church, or a perfect man. It is therefore my constant aim to agree with all the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    as far as I can, and not to quarrel though we differ in some points. In civil society, one family does not differ with another, because it hath not the same orders in every respect. Would to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    we observed the same rule in spirituals. The world falls out enough with us; it is pity we should fall out among ourselves. My brother, I have written to you out of the fulness of my heart; whether I shall see your face in the flesh, I know not. At present, my call is to <i>Scotland</i>.—If the cloud should move towards <i>Lincolnshire</i>, my answer is, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    lo I come!” I am quite confounded when I think that such a wretch as I should ever be employed in preaching the everlasting gospel. I often fall down under a sense of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    distinguishing mercy, and with awful adoration am frequently made to cry out, “Why me, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;
    why me?” O my brother, help me to praise the Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that taketh away the sins of the world. A wonderful work is carried on both at home and abroad. I shall be glad to hear from you again. Be pleased to direct as before. I am, in the bowels of <span

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter was sweet to my heart. Business prevented my answering it on shore. Our Saviour is pleased at this time to give me leisure and freedom. I will now endeavour to answer it on board. I need not tell you, I love you. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has often bore witness to our fellowship, by giving
    <a id="p392"></a>us his presence, and filling us as with new wine. What has happened of late to disunite, will in the end, I am persuaded, only promote a closer union. “Out of the eater will come forth meat, and out of the strong will come forth sweetness.” Blessed be our Saviour’s free grace! I feel my heart more and more enlarged towards, and more and more disposed to love and honour all denominations of believers, than ever I experienced before. In all societies of christians under heaven, there must necessarily be persons of a different standing in the school of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Those who are not solidly established in the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    will fall too much in love with the outward form of their particular church, be it what it will. But as the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gets the ascendency, the more they will be like him and his holy angels, and consequently rejoice when souls are brought to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    whatever instruments may be made use of for that purpose. If therefore some that you and I know, are too confined (as I believe is too much the case); if they do not preach more frequently, and abound more in good works, I think it is for want of having their hearts more inflamed with the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and their graces kept in more constant exercise. To stir up the gift of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that is in us, is an apostolical injunction; and if we do not keep upon our watch we shall fall into a false stillness. Nature loves ease; and as a blind zeal often prompts us to speak too much, so tepidity and lukewarmness often cause us to speak too little. Divine wisdom alone, is profitable to direct; and I would be very cautious how I speak, least I should take too much upon me. I love those you mention, from my soul; and all I can say is, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    do thou lead and guide both them and us.” We are blind helpless creatures. I wish there was more confidence between us all; but I see that none but the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    can outwardly unite us, and therefore I have now given it up into the Redeemer’s hand. Only this I pray, that I may be one of the first and not the last in bringing back the king. If I have at any time set improper bounds to the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    or grieved it in his children, I desire to be very low, and to be broken hearted for it. I am sure it hath not been done willingly. I must own, I have sometimes opposed you, because I think you have made, and are yet making, too much haste. You seem to be like-minded with those, who in our Saviour’s
    <a id="p393"></a>time thought that the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    would then come: but you know how our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    checked them for it, and told them, “it was not for them to know the particular times and seasons of his coming to set up his kingdom.” I believe with you, that our glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> is about to do great things. But how, when, and where, I leave to his divine, sovereign disposal. I desire strictly to mind the particular plan assigned me; at the same time to look about, and see what others the wonderful counsellor is pleased to employ in other districts: and though they may differ from me in some points, I wish them abundant prosperity in the name of our common <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I am of your mind with respect to the church of <i>England</i>. This, this is the constant, abiding, intense language of my heart; “<span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    let thy kingdom come.” You see, my dear brother, how fully I write to you. It is because I love you. O that we may be taught to bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of <span

I do not remember seeing you at <i>London</i>; but if you love the Redeemer in sincerity, and preach the gospel in the demonstration of the spirit and with power, I wish you all possible success in the name of the <span

    As for coming into your parts, it is intirely uncertain. My present call is to <i>Scotland</i>. How my Master will dispose of me hereafter, I know not. I simply desire to go whither he shall be pleased to call me. I am amazed that he should call me any where, or employ me as his ambassador to beseech poor sinners to be reconciled to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    But what shall we say? I can only fall down at the feet of the Lamb, and cry, Grace! grace! Of late the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath done greater things for me, and his church, than ever; and yet greater things I am persuaded he is about to bring to pass. Dear Sir, help me at the throne of grace, and as you seem to have a thirst for the Redeemer’s glory, recommend me to the prayers of <span

      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>.
    But what shall we say? The Redeemer’s love alone can unite and keep together his flocks. Disputing with bigots and narrow-spirited people will not do. I intend henceforward to say less to them, and pray more and more to our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> for them. “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    enlarge their hearts,” is my continual prayer for such, who are so streightened in their own bowels. Blessed be <span

    this partition-wall is breaking down daily in some of our old friends hearts in <i>London</i>. I exhort all to go where they can profit most. I preach what I believe to be the truth, and then leave it to the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to make the application. When we have done this, I think we have gone to the utmost bounds of our commission. O my brother, I find more and more, nothing but that wisdom, which is from above, can teach us how to build up souls. I never was so much assisted in this kind of work, as since I came to <i>London</i> last. We have public societies twice a week, and a general meeting for reading letters once a month. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has been much with us. We seem to move on now in gospel dignity, and are terrible as an army with banners. If the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    inclines you, a visit to <i>London</i> would be very acceptable. Our people can now bear searching more than formerly. I find that our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath particularly blessed you that way. We have had a most blessed funeral of one of our sisters in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and the awakening, I think, has been as great as when I first came out, and abundantly more solid. The <i>Easter</i> Holidays were high days indeed. My wife doth not forget her friends in <i>Wales</i>. But our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has seen fit to exercise her with exceeding close inward trials. She and all with me most cordially salute you. I expect great things in <i>Scotland</i>. If possible, at my return, I hope to see you in <i>Wales</i>. But future things belong to <span

    <span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM a heart overflowing with a sense of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    love, I write you these few lines. Yesterday our Saviour brought us hither. On board, I spent most part of my time in secret prayer. Satan shot many of his fiery darts against me. Our great <i>Michael</i> gave me a shield of faith, by which I was enabled to repel them all. As soon as I came on shore, the holy spirit filled my soul. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    commanded people to receive me and my fellow pilgrim into their houses. Our souls rejoiced in him. The people were soon alarmed at my arrival. As soon as I came on shore at <i>Leith</i>, many came blessing me, and weeping, took hold of me. About four in the afternoon we came to <i>Edinburgh</i>. Great numbers followed our coach, and almost catched me in their arms, as soon as I came out of it. How did they weep for joy! It would have melted you down to have seen them. When I came to my lodging, many dear friends came to salute us in the name of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    About seven o’clock I went to see some persons of distinction, whose hearts the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    reached, when I was here last. Some were ready to faint with excess of joy: with these I prayed and gave thanks. The Holy Ghost filled us with all joy and peace in believing.—At eight I went to a nobleman’s house, where his lady and several other dear friends received us with great gladness. The cushions and bible were immediately brought. I gave a word of exhortation. We sung, and prayed, and spent the remainder of the evening most delightfully in talking of the things of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    When we came home, we joined in blessing <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    holy name. Though late, I scarce knew how to go to rest.—This morning I received glorious accounts of the carrying on of the Mediator’s kingdom. The work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is beyond expression. Three of the little boys that were converted when I was last here, came to me and wept, and begged me to pray for and with them. A minister tells me, that scarce one is fallen back, who was awakened, either among old or young. The serjeant, whose letter, brother
    <a id="p400"></a><i>C――</i> has, goes on well with his company. O my dear brother, help me to praise the Lamb that sitteth upon the throne for ever; and desire all the society to join with you. I believe within these four months you will hear of very great things. Pray that I may be very little in my own eyes, and not rob my dear Master of any part of his glory. We do not forget you. Once a day we meet together and pray for absent friends. He gives us leave, as it were, to ask of him what we will, and promises never to leave or forsake us. For the present, my dear brother, adieu! As opportunity offers, and if possible every post, some or other of my dear friends shall hear, dear brother <i>A――</i>, from</p>

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>ESTERDAY morning our glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> brought us hither. Your Lordship’s kind letter was put into my hands. I heartily sympathize with your Lordship; but could not help rejoicing on your honoured lady’s account, knowing she is now entered into her blessed Master’s joy. Indeed, my Lord, I think, among christians, death hath not only lost its sting, but its name. I never was so joyful as I am now at the death of those who die in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;
    and never was so reconciled to living myself. My general language, when I hear of the saints departure, is, “Let them go.” Lately at <i>London</i> we had a sister in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    departed. Her last words were, “Holy, holy, holy!” she could say no more here; but our Saviour sent for her to finish her song in heaven. I preached over her corpse; our society attended: but surely never did souls triumph over death more than we did that night. Many would say, “O death! where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory?” As for my own part, I was enabled to trample death under my feet: and, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    through rich grace I can do that daily. But then your Lordship may ask, “Why are you reconciled to life?” Because
    <a id="p401"></a>I can do that for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    on earth, which I cannot do in heaven: I mean, be made instrumental in bringing some poor, weary, heavy laden sinners to find rest in his blood and righteousness: and, indeed, if our Saviour was to offer either to take me now, or to stay only to take one sinner more, I would desire to stay to take him with me. But whither am I running? O my Lord, death is a delightful topic. Excuse me if I forget myself when writing about it. Blessed be our <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for supporting your soul under so close a trial! How sweet will it be to meet your Lady glorified at the great day! Yet a little while, and that happy day shall come. But it is time to answer your Lordship’s question: “How was you on the <abbr
      title="twenty-fourth">24th</abbr>
    of last <i>November</i>?” I thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    very well. My soul was much refreshed with the Redeemer’s presence; and I was rejoicing in hope of the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I hear of wonderful things in <i>Scotland</i>. I can only fall down and worship. I have seen greater things than ever in <i>England</i>. I expect to see far greater in <i>Scotland</i>. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will not let his people be disappointed of their hopes. But I must away. We were very happy together with some other dear friends last night. I have not seen your Lordship’s daughters, though they have been so kind as to send to enquire after my health. I hope to see them to-day; and am, my Lord, with all possible respect, my Lord,</p>

    <i>Dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Arrived here last <i>Saturday</i> evening from the <i>West</i>, where I preached all the last week: as, twice on <i>Monday</i> at <i>Paisley</i>, six miles from <i>Glasgow</i>; on the <i>Tuesday</i> and <i>Wednesday</i>, three times each day, at <i>Irvine</i>, 16 miles from thence; on <i>Thursday</i>, twice at <i>Mearns</i>, fifteen miles from that; on <i>Friday</i>, three times at <a
      id="p403a" href="#tn_19">♦</a><i>Cumbernauld</i>;
    and on <i>Saturday</i>, twice at <i>Falkirk</i>, in my way to <i>Edinburgh</i>. In every place there was the greatest commotion among the people as was ever known. Their mourning in most of the places, was like the mourning for a first-born. The auditories were very large, and the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    seems to be spreading more and more. Last sabbath-day I preached twice in the park, and once in the church, and twice every day since. A number of seats and shades, in the form of an amphitheatre, have been erected in the park, where the auditory sit in a beautiful order. I have received very agreeable news from my family abroad.—I purpose going to <i>Cambuslang</i> to-morrow, in order to assist at the communion; and shall preach at various places westward before I return here. I intend to embark for <i>America</i> as soon as possible after I leave <i>Scotland</i>. Thus you see, my dear brother, how I have been employed. O give thanks to our blessed Saviour, for his great unparalleled goodness to a most unworthy worm. Indeed I have seen and felt such things, as I never saw and felt before. I never was enabled to preach so powerfully as whilst I have been in the <i>West</i>. I hear that brother <i>C――</i> is in the country, and that you exhort in the society. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    open your mouth, and cause your lips to shew forth his praise! Let us talk of his loving-kindness all the day long. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gives me faith for my poor orphans. Help me with your prayers. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will supply all my wants. Glory be to his name, I am kept from doubting. My brother, I love you dearly. You have been a close and faithful brother. May the <span

    bless you and yours. Adieu! Pray fail not of writing as particular as may be, to,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">L</span>AST <i>Monday</i> I received an agreeable packet of letters from you. I think they are dated in <i>October</i> and <i>December</i> last. They rejoiced our hearts. As soon as I read yours, my wife said, let us give thanks and pray. Accordingly we kneeled down, and had very near access to the Father of Mercies on your behalf. At night, after our coming home, we did the same. Our common <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enabled us to wrestle in faith. We all felt our hearts drawn mightily towards you. I could wish for wings to fly unto you. I long to thank you in person, for your faithfulness to your poor unworthy, but most affectionate friend. My dear brother, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is still doing greater things for me than ever. The awakening here in <i>Scotland</i> is unspeakable. The congregations in the <i>West</i>, are just like those which you and I saw at <i>Foggs-Manor</i>, in <i>Pensylvania</i>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    seems to awaken scores together. I never was enabled to preach so before. O that I may lie low at the feet of my dear Redeemer! to whose image I am studying to be more conformed every day. Your letter to dear brother <i>A――</i> pleased us very much. I have desired him to print it. I paid a three hundred pound bill drawn upon me by <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>N――</i>, as well as <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>’s:
    whether you include that in the eleven thousand pounds, I know not. However, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    if it were eleven thousand more I hope I should be kept from doubting. At present, I am looking up to our great Housholder for fresh supplies; which I believe he will give me, and which I will send to you as soon as possible. I hope to see you soon, and to thank you in particular for your faithfulness to me. My friend and brother, you shall in no wise lose your reward. I believe <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will take <i>Georgia</i> into his own hands. Its affairs have lately been before the House of Commons. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Ste――</i>
    was reprimanded for his abuse of the trustees; the use of rum was granted, but the use of slaves denied. Let us stand still, be instant in prayer, and we shall
    <a id="p405"></a>certainly see the salvation of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I am yet made to hope against hope, in behalf of poor <i>Georgia</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    strengthen your weak body, and continually comfort your soul. That you may be filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,

    <i>My dear Love</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE I wrote the last, I have seen such things as I never beheld before. Yesterday morning I preached at <i>Glasgow</i> to a very large congregation. At noon I came to <i>Cambuslang</i>, the place which <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath so much honoured. I preached at two, to a vast body of people, and at six in the evening, and again at nine at night. Such a commotion surely never was heard of, especially at eleven at night. It far out-did all that I ever saw in <i>America</i>. For about an hour and a half there was such weeping, so many falling into deep distress, and expressing it various ways, as is inexpressible. The people seem to be slain by scores. They are carried off, and come into the house like soldiers wounded in, and carried off a field of battle. Their cries and agonies are exceedingly affecting. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>
    preached after I had ended, till past one in the morning, and then could scarce persuade them to depart. All night in the fields, might be heard the voice of prayer and praise. Some young ladies were found by a gentlewoman praising <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    at break of day. She went and joined with them. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is indeed much with me. I have preached twice to-day already, and am to preach twice, perhaps three times more. The commotions increase. To-morrow, and on sabbath-day, I shall preach at <i>Calder</i>; on <i>Monday</i>, here again; and on <i>Tuesday</i> at <i>Kilsyth</i>, and then, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

    <i>Reverend and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter gave me some little concern, I thought it breathed much of a sectarian spirit; to which I hoped dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    was quite averse. Methinks you seem, dear Sir, not satisfied, unless I declare myself a Presbyterian, and openly renounce the church of <i>England</i>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows that I have been faithful in bearing a testimony against what I think is corrupt in that church. I have shewn my freedom in communicating with the church of <i>Scotland</i>, and in baptizing children their own way. I can go no further. As for what you mention about the Quakers, I know not what particular exceptionable passages there were in my sermons, in which I mentioned them. That some good souls are among the Quakers, I doubt not.—For such I have charity, because our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath given to them his spirit.—Though I am a strenuous defender of the righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and utterly detest <i>Arminian</i> principles, yet I know that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    gave me the Holy Ghost, before I was clear in either as to head-knowledge: and therefore, dear Sir, I am the more moderate to people who are not clear, supposing I see the divine image stamped upon their hearts. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    I take to be holy men of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    though they think far widely from me, and from each other in some particular branches of doctrine. Dear Sir, be not offended at my plain speaking. I find but few of a truly catholic spirit. Most are catholic till they bring persons over to their own party, and there they would fetter them. I have not so learned <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>. I desire to act as <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    acts. I shall approve, and join with all who are good in every sect, and cast a mantle of love over all that are bad, so far as is consistent with a good conscience. This I can do without temporizing; nay I should defile my conscience if I did otherwise. As for my answer to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>,
    dear Sir, it is very satisfying to my own soul. Morning and evening retirement is certainly exceeding good; but if through weakness of body, or frequency of preaching, I cannot go to
    <a id="p407"></a><span class="smcap">God</span> in my usual set times, I think my spirit is not in bondage. It is not for me to tell how often I use secret prayer; if I did not use it, nay, if in one sense I did not pray without ceasing, it would be difficult for me to keep up that frame of soul, which by the divine blessing I daily enjoy. If the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    prospers, and your hands become more full, you will then, dear Sir, know better what I mean. But enough of this. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows my heart, I would do every thing I possibly could, to satisfy all men, and give a reason of the hope that is in me with meekness and fear; but I cannot satisfy all that are waiting for an occasion to find fault: our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    could not; I therefore despair of doing it. However, dear Sir, I take what you have said in very good part: only I think you are too solicitous to clear up my character to captious and prejudiced men. Let my master speak for me. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    he will, so long as I simply throw myself into his almighty arms. I am glad the work goes on with you. Glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we have seen glorious things in the <i>West</i>. My tender love to all that are pleased to remember me. When I shall come your way, I know not. On <i>Friday</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I go to <i>Cambuslang</i>, where I expect to see great days of the son of man. That <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may bless you abundantly more and more, and cause your latter end greatly to increase, is the hearty prayer of, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">O</span>N <i>Saturday</i> I received your very kind letter, and being just now returned from <i>Cambuslang</i>, I snatch a few moments to acknowledge it. I have long since waited for a call to <i>Ireland</i>. In such an important step, I care not to proceed without great caution. When I find the cloud of divine providence moving your way, I trust the language of my heart will be, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I come to do or suffer thy will! In the mean while, I will watch unto prayer. I doubt not but you, reverend
    <a id="p408"></a>and dear Sir, will help me herein. I thank you most heartily, for being jealous over me. I believe it is with a godly jealousy. I wish I was more jealous over myself. But blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    this I can say in the midst of the honours wherewith the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> hath honoured me, “Not unto me, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    not unto me, but unto thy name be all the glory.” Dear Sir, I think I am the worst of the sons of men. Yet I dare not deny what the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath done for my sinful soul. He is pleased (O infinitely condescending <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!)
    to honour me still more and more. <i>Saturday</i> last I came to <i>Cambuslang</i>, and I think I never saw such things before. The work seems to be spreading. O that it may reach and overspread poor <i>Ireland</i> also! All things are possible with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. Now the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is watering so many other places, I pray he may not leave that intirely destitute and dry.—O for faith to expect great, and very great things from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    He does not love to disappoint people of their hope. Dear Sir, my heart is now enlarged with a sense of the freeness and fulness of the Redeemer’s loving-kindness. You, dear Sir, are an old weather beaten soldier. You are ripened for glory, and are ready to sing your <span

        lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc dimittis</i><a
        href="#fn_3" class="anchor">¹</a></span>.—I
    am just about to begin to be a soldier. But, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I shall follow soon. The hopes of bringing more souls to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    is the only consideration that can reconcile me to life. For this cause I can willingly stay long from my wish’d-for home, my wished-for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    But whither am I going? I forget myself when writing of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    His love fills my soul, O free grace! Surely I shall sing the loudest in heaven; but I must have done; nature calls for rest. Depending on the continuance of your prayers, and with my hearty salutation to all that love the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    I subscribe myself, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    <i>My dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">O</span>F all my fellow-labourers letters, I think yours come the sweetest to my soul. You do not forget the rock from whence you was hewn, and therefore the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will honour you more and more. Though I have so small a degree of humility myself, I can see and admire it in others. It is the queen of graces. O beg of the exalted <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to make me humble. Indeed I have need of humility, for I am honoured more and more. What I have sent you already, does not near come up to what I have seen since. Last <i>Thursday</i> night, and <i>Friday</i> morning, there was such a shock in <i>Edinburgh</i> as I never felt before. O what a melting and weeping was there! I have heard blessed effects of it since. All glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span> through <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    On <i>Friday</i> night I came to <i>Cambuslang</i>, to assist at the blessed sacrament. On <i>Saturday</i> I preached to above twenty thousand people. In my prayer the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    came down and was greatly felt. In my two sermons, there was yet more power. On sabbath day, scarce ever was such a sight seen in <i>Scotland</i>. There were undoubtedly upwards of twenty thousand people. Two tents were set up, and the holy sacrament was administered in the fields. When I began to serve a table, the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was felt by numbers; but the people crouded so upon me, that I was obliged to desist and go to preach at one of the tents, whilst the ministers served the rest of the tables. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was with them, and with his people. There was preaching all day by one or another, and in the evening, when the sacrament was over, at the request of the ministers I preached to the whole congregation. I preached about an hour and a half. Surely it was a time much to be remembered. On <i>Monday</i> morning, I preached again to near as many; but such an universal stir I never saw before. The motion fled as swift as lightning from one end of the auditory to another. You might have seen thousands bathed in tears. Some at the same time wringing their hands, others almost swooning, and others
    <a id="p410"></a>crying out, and mourning over a pierced Saviour. But I must not attempt to describe it. In the afternoon, the concern again was very great. Much prayer had been previously put up to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    All night in different companies, you might have heard persons praying to, and praising <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. The children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    came from all quarters. It was like the passover in <i>Josiah</i>’s time. We are to have another in about two or three months, if the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> will. One <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>,
    a minister, who has great popular gifts, was as well as others much owned and helped at this time. On <i>Tuesday</i> morning I preached at <i>Glasgow</i>, (it was a most glorious time) and in the afternoon twice at <i>Inchannon</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gave a blow to many. Yesterday morning I preached there again, and here twice. Every time there was a great stir, especially at this place. A great company of awakened souls is within the compass of twenty miles, and the work seems to be spreading apace. I am exceedingly strengthened, O unmerited mercy! both in soul and body, and cannot now do well without preaching three times a day. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gives me great confidence about the Orphan-house, and assures me that he will provide for me and mine. O help me to thank him. Call upon all to bless his holy name. I know you will not be slack to praise him. I rejoice, my dear brother, to find that you enjoy so much of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    May he fill you with all his fulness. The trials you meet with, will only make you a more able minister of the New Testament. I am of your mind with respect to ――. He will not prosper. The <span

    hates sectarian zeal. Dear brother, adieu. Expect to hear every opportunity from</p>

In reading it, I thought of the great <i>Austin</i>, who used, when he prayed against lust, secretly to wish that his prayer might not be answered, and yet he made a most eminent saint, and shone in the church as a star of the first magnitude. I likewise thought how our Saviour would receive you, if here on earth; even as he received and answered the poor woman taken in adultery.—I am sure he would say, “Neither do I condemn thee.” Another text offers itself, “I will heal their backslidings, and love them freely.” <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    does not say, I will heal thy backsliding for any certain term of years, but I will heal thy backslidings in general. Dear Sir, if you have been a backslider these fifty years, nay, was it possible for you to have been a backslider a thousand years, yet if with hearty repentance and true faith you turn unto him, he will abundantly pardon you. O dear Sir, if any one had need to despair of
    <a id="p412"></a>mercy, I had; but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has washed me in his blood, and I know that my Redeemer liveth. Your temptations, and atheism, and hard thoughts of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    do not surprize me. Dear Sir, what else can be expected from a heart desperately wicked, and deceitful above all things? Dear Sir, let all this drive you to the fountain which is open for sin and all uncleanness. I once, in your circumstances, thought <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    was hard-hearted; but now I find, nay have long since found, that his heart is full of love. Take courage, dear Sir; draw near to the Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that taketh away the sin of the world. Return, thou wandering prodigal, thy heavenly father is running to meet thee.—Come back, thou fluttering dove, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is ready to take thee into the ark. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    bless this to you! If he does, I will bless his name. I am a vile sinner, and have need to lie low before him, whom I have pierced by my transgression and unprofitableness, times without number. In his blood and righteousness I find perpetual refuge. Many in these parts are flying to him. May you, Sir, add to the happy number. You are but a sinner, and <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    died for sinners. Come and welcome to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I expect to remain in <i>Scotland</i> a few months, and hope to be your way, if the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    direct. If your way should be directed hither, I should be glad to see you; if not, you are welcome to write to me. As my multiplicity of affairs will admit, you shall be answered by, dear Sir,</p>

      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    His word runs and is much glorified in these parts. I trust it also makes advances in your soul. How is it with you, my dear brother <i>R――</i>? Do you grow in grace? Is the world more under your feet than usual? Do you find a real, solid, abiding rest in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>?
    Or is it only transitory and superficial? It is a very uncommon thing to be rooted and grounded in the love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    I find persons may have the idea, but are far from having the real substance. To say, “I am a poor sinner,” and to be a poor sinner indeed, are two different things. Methinks I hear my dear man say, and so they are. Well then, let us go to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and he will make us poor and yet free. Blessed be his name, I feel the power of his precious, life-giving, all-atoning blood more and more every day. I was happy when at <i>London</i>. I am ten times happier now. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad. How is my dear <i>Peter</i>? Is his heart yet established and settled upon the rock? Or is the dove only fluttering about the door of the ark? If so, may the dear Redeemer reach out his almighty and extended arm, and take him in! Dear <i>B――</i> I hope grows, because he seems to see more of his heart. We shall certainly bear fruit upwards, in proportion as we take root downwards. May the eternal spirit breathe upon this letter, and bless it to your soul! O my brother, keep close to <span

    hath made me often to pray for you, and also to hope, that in time you would be brought to love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    himself. I trust that time is now come, and that the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> hath at length captivated and taken full possession of your heart. Will you give me leave to ask a few friendly questions? Has religion sunk out of your head into your heart? You was civilized when I was at <i>London</i>: Are you yet really converted? Your affections were now and then raised towards,—are they now centered in and fixed on the <span

    If you can answer these questions in the affirmative, I pronounce you a wise virgin, even wise to eternal salvation; blessed art thou among women. If not, I do not despair of you. <span

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>

    <a id="p417"></a>need) gladly have washed your feet. I doubt not but your imprisonment was for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake. I am persuaded, the letter from your friend that doubted, was the sorest stab of all; but all is intended to draw us from the creature, even from the new creature, and bring us nearer to the Creator, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    blessed for evermore. <i>Paul</i>’s friends deserted, and no doubt judged him. “All they in <i>Asia</i> forsook me,” says he; and again, “At my first trial no man stood by me;” and what follows? but “the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    stood by me:” and will he not, dear brother, also stand by you? I cannot help believing but that <i>Georgia</i> will yet be a glorious colony. The counsel of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    shall stand. He surely put it into my heart to build the Orphan-house. He certainly brought you to <i>Georgia</i> to superintend it. He will bless you and yours. I join in blessing <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    with you, and in admiring how he has spread a table for my dear family in that wilderness. But what shall we say? The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    loves to encourage faith; and since his honour is so much concerned, I am sure he will vindicate it, and never suffer his enemies to say thus of us, “There, there, so would we have it.” I am kept from the least doubting; and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows how many prayers of faith I have put up for you. I have often wished as it were for the wings of a dove, that I might fly unto you, and take you one by one into my unworthy arms, and weep over you with tears of love. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the time draws near apace. I am just now about to publish a further account of the Orphan-house, and hope shortly to collect some more money towards its support. I am blessed with far greater success than ever, and satan roars louder. You will see by what I here send, how the archers of different classes shoot at me; but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    (for ever adored be his never-failing love) causes my bow to abide in strength, and enables me to triumph in every place. The comforts and success the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> gives to me, is unspeakable. Last <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    day, I believe there were here thirty thousand people, and above two thousand five hundred communicants. The work spreads, and I believe will yet spread. My bodily strength is daily renewed, and I mount on the wings of faith and love like an eagle. I can only cry Grace! grace! My dear brother, I feel every day more and more, that I am a poor, very poor sinner. I often wonder why <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span> suffers me to
    <a id="p418"></a>live, much more to speak for him. But he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy. O free grace! Oh unparalleled love of an infinitely condescending <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    Whilst I am musing, the fire kindles. Surely we shall have a happy meeting in <i>Georgia</i>. My Master will, I trust, come along with me. Otherwise, may I not go up hence. In the mean while, I pray him to quicken and revive your dear souls, and fill you as with new wine. Thus he deals with me and mine daily. I am retired for a day, on purpose to write letters. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    bless them to your dear souls, whom I love in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I wish you had told me who stood by at <i>Savannah</i> and brought you refreshment. Greet them, and give them particular thanks in my name. My heart is full; I know not how to stop.

    <i>Honoured Gentlemen</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>OME letters, which I received last week from <i>Georgia</i>, occasion my troubling you with this, which I doubt not will meet with a candid reception at your hands. I find that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i> and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    have been taken up by a warrant, and were imprisoned above a week, for a thing which, I believe, none of you, honoured gentlemen, will judge cognizable by the civil magistrate. It seems that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    in a private conversation with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>O――</i>,
    (who, I suppose, is the present minister of <i>Savannah</i>) told him, “He was no ‘christian’; that he wondered at the impudence of young men in subscribing articles they did not believe; and that he should think it his duty to warn his friends not to hear him.” I acknowledge
    <a id="p419"></a>that such language was too harsh; but <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    who did not say near so much, was linked in the same prosecution, and imprisoned with him. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>,
    who was then at <i>Frederica</i>, being informed of it, declared such a procedure to be illegal; and his Excellency General <i>Oglethorp</i>, desired my friends to lay the matter before the board of the Honourable Trustees. I being now upon the spot, they have sent to me a very particular account of what has passed; which, if you please, honoured gentlemen, I will transmit unto you, or, when I come to <i>London</i>, will wait upon you in person. I find also, that my friends were denied a copy of the proceedings of the court: in which, I am persuaded the honourable gentlemen to whom I am writing, will think they have been wronged. My friends require no satisfaction, but only desire such a proceeding may be animadverted upon; knowing that otherwise it will be a great discouragement to people’s settling in <i>Georgia</i>. I am sorry also to inform you, honoured gentlemen, that five very small children, (<i>Swiss</i> or <i>Dutch</i>) whose parents lately died in their passage from <i>England</i>, have had their goods sold at <i>Vendue</i>, and are bound out till the age of twenty-one years. This I think directly contrary to the grant given me by you, honoured gentlemen; for thereby I was impowered to take as many orphans into the house as my fund would admit of. The magistrates, I understand, have also been at the Orphan-house, and claim a power to take away the children when they please, whether the children chuse it, or complain of ill-treatment, or not. This grieves some of the children, and makes others of them insolent, who are hereby taught, that they have a power to go away when they will. This, honoured gentlemen, must be very discouraging to those who are entrusted with their education; and who, I am persuaded, aim at nothing but the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the welfare of the colony, and the salvation of the children’s souls. I suppose that the magistrates (I mean <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i> and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>)
    have taken such a liberty from the instructions which were sent, honoured gentlemen, from you some time ago. But <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>
    has told them, they have misunderstood you; and his Excellency General <i>Oglethorp</i> I find has wrote to you, honoured gentlemen, about it. By the
    <a id="p420"></a>accounts I have, our plantation thrives well; and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    hopes we shall do with white servants alone. I do assure you, honoured gentlemen, I will do all I can, with the most disinterested views, to promote the good of <i>Georgia</i>: only I beg the management of the Orphan-house, and orphans, may be secured to me and my successors for ever; and that the magistrates be not suffered to disturb us, when there is no ground of complaint. They acknowledged, when at the Orphan-house last, that the children were taken good care of, both as to their bodies and souls; and will it not then, honoured gentlemen, tend much to the welfare of the colony, that the Orphan-house should meet with all possible encouragement. His Excellency General <i>Oglethorp</i> has informed my friend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    that, if I desired it, he thought you would grant me a greater tract of land, which I should be obliged to give away in a certain term of years, and that we might have our own magistrates, as have the people of <i>Ebenezer</i>. Whether I shall desire such a favour, I know not; but, if I should, I desire to know, what you, honoured gentlemen, would say to it. Many have applied to me to settle in <i>Georgia</i>; hitherto I could give them no encouragement. I wish I may be enabled to give them a great deal for the future. Indeed, honoured gentlemen, I do not desire to find fault. I doubt not but you have been prejudiced both against me and my friends. The event will shew what friends we are to <i>Georgia</i>. The Orphan-house will certainly be of great utility to the colony; and the children educated therein, I trust, will be the glory of the society to which they belong. They are bred up to industry, as well as to other things; and are taught to fear <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and honour the king. I am glad to hear that you have lately sent over a gentleman who (I suppose) will do justice. I think I desire nothing else; and heartily pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to bless him, and you, honoured gentlemen, and all that are concerned in the management of <i>Georgia</i> affairs. I hope to be in town in about two months; in the mean while, I would beg the favour of a line by your secretary; and also entreat you, honoured gentlemen, to write to the magistrates of <i>Savannah</i>, to let the Orphan-house managers alone. If I or my friends should happen to say or do any thing amiss, I assure you, honoured
    <a id="p421"></a>gentlemen, you shall have all possible satisfaction given you by them, and also by, honoured gentlemen,</p>

    <i>My very dear Friend and Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH a great deal of pleasure I received your letters dated <i>May <abbr
      title="fourteenth">14th</abbr></i>, <i><abbr
      title="twenty-sixth">26th</abbr></i>, <i><abbr
      title="twenty-ninth">29th</abbr></i>, and <i>June <abbr
      title="first">1st</abbr></i>. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    for all his goodness, in providing for my dear family in that wilderness, by such various unexpected ways. It caused my heart to leap for joy. I find you have been wrongfully imprisoned. I should have been glad (if time had permitted) that you had wrote me word, how it has been with your soul under such a circumstance. I hope the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    and of glory rested upon you. Glad should I have been to have sung and prayed with you; but my hour is not yet come. I have just now wrote to the trustees, and intend waiting upon them as soon as I come to <i>London</i>. I am persuaded the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will influence their hearts to do us justice. I am glad you wrote so properly to the General, and that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath given you favour in his sight. “When a man’s ways please the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    he makes his very enemies to be at peace with him.” I intend sending him and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Jones</i>
    a letter of thanks. I owe <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    only about ninety pounds, and about a hundred and fifty more in all, upon the Orphan-house account in <i>England</i>. I am just publishing a further account, which I am persuaded the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will bless. I would not have you to undertake any business you do not like. I think the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has fitted you for your present station. Professor <i>Franck</i> held it dangerous to change persons frequently, who were entrusted with the care of the orphans. I am of your opinion as to hiring servants.—It is impossible to tell you, my dear man, what I have seen, heard, and felt since I came last to <i>Scotland</i>. The glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> rides daily on in the chariot of his gospel, from conquering and to conquer. The
    <a id="p422"></a>congregations are just like that at <i>Fogg-Manor</i>.—I am opposed on all sides. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>E――</i>’s
    people have lately kept a fast upon my account. The kirk presbyters also, now they see the Seceders splitting, notwithstanding I have been instrumental in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    hands, in some degree, in stopping the secession, begin to call some of their ministers to account for employing me: but who can stand before envy? In the midst of all, my dear Master keeps me leaning upon himself, and causes me to walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghost from morning to night. I wish time would have allowed you to have wrote a little about his love, and to have abounded more in thanks for the opportune supplies which he sent you. But I am sure that my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    is not wanting in either of these. I think that I see you grow in grace. I assure you, you are dearer to me than ever. My wife readily excuses your not writing, knowing what it is to be in a hurry of business. O pray that we may have a prosperous voyage to you, by the will of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    By this time I suppose you are a father. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    teach you and your wife how to order the child! I have much to say to you both, when I see you. My dear old friend, and first fellow-traveller, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has yet great blessings in store for us. He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that lead a godly life. Methinks I am conversing with you now. May <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give us a happy meeting! He will, he will! For the present I must bid my dear man good night. I stole this day from public preaching, to dispatch my private affairs. All join in hearty love to, and prayers for you. Accept of the same in the most tender manner, from, my dear <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Most heartily thank you for being so kind to my family in <i>Georgia</i>, and for espousing my friends cause when I think they were apparently wronged. In a letter, I yesterday laid the case before the honourable trustees, not doubting but they will preserve us from oppression, and from persecution in all its shapes. I think we have only the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and the good of the colony at heart. Prejudices may be raised against us by evil reports and misrepresentations; but your Excellency is more noble than to hearken to insinuations, which are not supported by evident matters of fact. I am sure <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will bless you for defending the cause of the fatherless, and espousing the cause of injured innocence. My friends, I trust, will at all times readily acknowledge any thing they may either say or do wrong; and, if I know any thing of my own heart, I would not offend any one causelessly and wilfully, for the world. In a few months I hope to see <i>Georgia</i>. In the mean while, I beg your Excellency to accept these few lines of thanks from, honoured Sir,</p>

    I am glad to find you was so well reconciled to your dear husband’s imprisonment. It is sweet when wives are strengthened to encourage their husbands in a suffering hour.

    I have a fountain to go and wash in every moment, even the blessed fountain of the Mediator’s blood. There I can have free access; there I can wash, and daily be made clean. Indeed, my dear sister, without dissimulation, I am a poor, very poor sinner; but I am rich in <span

    <i>My very dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">G</span>LAD was I last night to receive a letter from your hands. I love your simple honest heart, and earnestly pray the dear Redeemer to give you a true, lasting, abiding rest in himself. Blessed be his name, I think I can say, through free grace, that I am in a measure entered into it, and know what it is by happy experience, to pass from glory to glory every day. My dear brother, I am opposed on every side; the archers shoot sore at me that I may fall, but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is my helper. He causes my bow to abide in strength, and makes me more than conqueror through his love. The account sent with this, will shew you how often I have been enabled to preach; but with what efficacy and success, pen cannot describe. The glorious Redeemer seems to be advancing from congregation to congregation, carrying all before him. The <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr> <i>E――</i>’s
    people have kept a fast for me, and give out, that all the work now in <i>Scotland</i> is only delusion, and by the agency of the devil. O, my dear brother, to what great lengths in bigotry and prejudice may good men run? Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, I can see the differences between <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    children, and yet love them from my heart. What you said about poor <i>Wales</i>, affected me. I laid upon my face this day, and for some time pleaded with groans unutterable, for direction in that, and several other matters of great consequence. I fear my dear brother thinks too highly of me. Indeed, I feel myself to be a poor sinner, and yet I am rich in
    <a id="p427"></a><span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and lean upon his bosom from morning to night; nay, all the night long. By his grace alone I am what I am; and if he is pleased to honour me so far, I should be glad to help the brethren in <i>Wales</i>. I am sorry to hear there has been such divisions. But dividing times generally precede settling times. Upon the receipt of your last, I wrote to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>O――</i>.
    Last night I received his answer. He speaks very honourably of you, but thinks that you are too censorious, in condemning a whole society for the faults of but some, and too bigotted also to your own way. My dear brother will excuse this. I would not deal so freely, or take such liberty, did I not believe you would take it kindly. My brother, my soul loves you. Dear Miss <i>Nancy</i> wrote me word you was at my house, (I rejoiced) and that you prayed heartily for unworthy me. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    reward, and fill you with all joy and peace in believing! Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is sovereign in his dealing with his dear children. I walk in much liberty. O free grace! Your being so exercised with inward conflicts, helps you to search hypocrites. But glory be to our heavenly Father, there is a glorious rest awaits us, and all the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I think I feel a foretaste of it now; nay, I believe I feel the thing itself in a degree, and when I speak of it, I speak what I know. O infinitely condescending <span
      class="smcap">God</span>! My brother, my heart is full. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    bless you, and fill your dear soul with all his fulness! So prays, with his whole heart,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS day fortnight I came to this place, to assist at the sacramental occasion with several worthy ministers of the church of <i>Scotland</i>. Such a passover has not been heard of. The voice of prayer and praise was heard all night. It was supposed, that between 30 and 40,000 people were assembled, and 3000 communicated. There were three tents. The ministers were enlarged, and great grace was among the people. I preached once on <i>Saturday</i>, once on the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    <a id="p429"></a>Day morning, served five tables, and preached about ten at night to a great number in the Church-yard. Though it rained much, there was a great awakening. On <i>Monday</i> at seven in the morning, the Reverend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Webster</i>
    preached, and there was a very great commotion, and also in the third sermon when I preached, a very great and serious concern was visible through the whole solemnity. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    people went home much refreshed. On <i>Thursday</i> I preached twice at <i>Greenock</i>; on <i>Friday</i> three times at <i>Kilbride</i>, and again on <i>Saturday</i> once, and twice at <i>Stevenson</i>; on <i>Sunday</i> four times at <i>Irvine</i>. On <i>Monday</i> once at <i>Irvine</i>, and three times at <i>Kilmarnock</i>; on <i>Tuesday</i> once at <i>Kilmarnock</i>, and four times at <i>Stewarton</i>; on <i>Wednesday</i> once at <i>Stewarton</i>, and twice at the <i>Mearnes</i>; and yesterday twice at this place. I never preached with so much apparent success before. At <i>Greenock</i>, <i>Irvine</i>, <i>Kilbride</i>, <i>Kilmarnock</i>, and <i>Stewarton</i>, the concern was great: at the three last very extraordinary. The work seems to spread more and more. O, my friend, pray and give praise in behalf of the most unworthy wretch that was ever employed in the dear Redeemer’s service. I speak this from my inmost soul. I must cry out continually, “Why me <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    why me?” My dear brother <i>A――</i>, I love you dearly in the bowels of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>.
    I think I could live with you always. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I think, hath given you a meek and teachable disposition. O what is it to be as little children! I am glad to find, you so hunger and thirst after a continual abiding rest in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. Assure yourself, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will fill and satisfy your soul. He is faithful, who hath promised, who also will do it. Wait, and thou shalt see and feel the salvation of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I think I have seen it more for some days past, than in any journey before. Our Saviour loves to let us see yet greater things. O for a large heart to receive all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>! I rejoice to hear that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is with you at the Tabernacle. May his glory appear, and shine in it more and more! I believe it will: I believe <span

    <a id="p430"></a>watch in reality, and from moment to moment hear the cry of every Christian, with every call from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    whether by his providence or spirit. It is said, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    brought and kept <i>Abraham</i> at his feet. O that we were always there, waiting for divine direction! Blessed be his name, I am for the most part at the feet of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and indeed he graciously teaches me moment after moment. I have many things before me now. I know brother <i>A――</i> will help me by his prayers. Blessed be <span

    indeed dwell with such a wretch as I am.” Methinks a voice echo’s from above, “I have dwelt in thee, I do dwell in thee, I will dwell in thee for evermore.” My heart replies, “<span

    This, my dear brother, is the present, and indeed continual bent of my soul, which I trust prospers. I feel myself to grow more poor inwardly; I see, I am but a learner in the school of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and my dear Master teaches me new lessons every day. About a week ago, I think he did more for me than ever I saw before. Glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that he is so much with you at <i>London</i>. I rejoice, yea and I will rejoice. I am amazed when I hear, as I do almost every day, of some fresh persons wrought upon by my unworthy ministry. This humbles me very much, and brings me very low at the feet of the ever-loving <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    I dare not deny that I am one of his chosen; but I am jealous for myself and for those about me, lest we should grieve the holy Spirit, and oblige him to withdraw
    <a id="p431"></a>for our ingratitude, unfruitfulness, pride, selfishness, and insensibility of the blessings we enjoy. Last night I went to sleep quite angry, but chiefly with myself.—I saw that I had received much, and did so little for my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, and <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    that I could feelingly smite upon my breast, lay my head upon my pillow, and close my eyes with these words, “<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be merciful to me a sinner?” And to-day, what have I seen and felt, yea what do I now feel? My soul is swallowed up in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    His presence is filling my soul, and renewing my bodily strength. Here is free grace, my dear brother. Was you here, I think I could now warm your heart with a lecture upon the unparalleled love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>; but time is short: blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    an eternity is before me, but “eternity too short to utter all his praise.” I think I love you and yours unfeignedly, and rejoice that you enjoy sweet fellowship together. Glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that you have gotten many living stones. Trust the great Redeemer, the all-wise contriver and perfecter of his spiritual temple, to put them together. I have been faulty in looking too much to foreign help, and despising that which <span
      class="smcap">God</span> had given me. When our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was to feed the multitude, he would not create new bread, but multiplied the loaves that were already at hand. “Ye need not send them away, give ye them to eat,” said he: so say I to my dear brethren at the tabernacle. “Work with the materials you have.” In doing the work, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will teach you how to do it.—Experience will grow up with the work itself. Thus <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath dealt with me, and so he continues to deal. May his blessed spirit guide you all into all truth, and give you a right judgment in all things! I love to see the little child in others, though I see so little of it in my unworthy self. But I must not exceed; other business demands my attention. Write to me often about the state of the church. <abbr

    My dear brother, it is a delightful situation: <i>Mary</i> found it so. O true poverty of spirit, what a rare, yet what a precious thing it is! The foundation of it, is a deep, abiding knowledge of the corruption of the heart, and its desperate wickedness. I find more and more the necessity of leaning upon my beloved, whilst travelling through the wilderness of this world. I find I am yet but learning in the school of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and scarce know any thing as I ought to know. I often blush at a sense of my unfruitfulness, ingratitude, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    and yet am made continually to rejoice in his great salvation. My brother, press on and faint not; though faint, yet still pursue. When your father and mother forsake you, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will take you up. I do not wonder at your father’s opposition. His letter bespeaks him to be a man of a very bad spirit. I thought proper to burn it. My brother, pray for him, and beg of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    that you may behave with all meekness, humility and love. I would enlarge, but time is short, and much of my dear Master’s business is lying before me. For the present, adieu! My kind love to all. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    keep you unspotted from the world. You shall overcome by the blood of the Lamb. We see wond’rous things here. Pray and give thanks for</p>

    <a id="p433"></a>been upon my heart. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    you may be enabled, at this time especially, to plead the promise of temporal blessings. Remember, my dear brother, you can call <span

      class="smcap">God</span> and Father: if so, your <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    I have for these eight or nine years past, had no visible settled fund, but fetched in all temporal supplies by pleading the promises. My <span

    never failed me, he never will. This morning I have been lecturing upon <i>Elisha</i>’s multiplying the widow’s oil. The <span

    who hath made any thing that I have spoken of use to your soul. Tell your wife, she must take my advice, and pray with you. She sins, I think, in omitting it. I rejoice to hear that the <span

    is with you at the tabernacle. May he be with you more and more! My brother, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have just been writing to our dear brother <i>G―― T――</i>, and now sit down to write to you. Both your letters came to me at the same time, and had I not been used to trials of that nature, would have affected me much. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>
    speaks many things, that I know are too true of the <i>Moravian Brethren</i>; but his spirit seems to be too much heated, and I fear some of his own wild-fire is mixed with that sacred fire of zeal, which comes from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. My dear brother,
    <a id="p434"></a>I want to be more like unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who sees and corrects all things that are amiss, and yet continues unmoved in his own nature. I want to be more like unto <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    blessed for evermore! who sees all the quarrels and heart-risings of his children one amongst another, and yet bears with, and loves them still. My heart doth not reproach me, for my kindness and friendship with those that differ from me. I think I have been led by the word and spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    into this part of my conduct; but I confess that I am jealous, and trust with a godly jealousy, over many who talk and write of the Lamb, and who mimic some particular persons in their outward way of behaviour, but yet are not truly poor in spirit. They act too much like me, who at my first setting out imitated the outward shew of humility in Monsieur <i>Dezenly</i>, before I got true simplicity of heart. Indeed, I have too little of it now. But, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    by his free grace, I am what I am. I think I can say I am made unfeignedly happy in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    and can discover in some measure between a false and disguised holiness. Glory be to the Redeemer’s name, I walk in light and liberty, and am enabled to rejoice in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    always. Though I can say to corruption, “Thou art my sister,” yet I can with a full assurance of faith at all times say, “<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is my father, and all is mine, because I am <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s.”
    My dear, very dear host and brother, I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that you and I may more experience the glorious liberty of the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>:
    a liberty not from the in-being, but from the reigning power and dominion of sin. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    came to make us kings, as well as priests, and it is our privilege to reign upon the earth. We that believe, do enter into rest. Faith is of an all-conquering nature, and causes us to trample sin, death, and hell under our feet. My dear brother, I experience more, unspeakably more of the Redeemer’s power, than when I saw you last. My happiness increases daily, and I am persuaded will increase, ’till grace is swallowed up in glory. My principles as to the fundamentals of the gospel are just the same as yours. I cannot renounce those precious truths, that I have felt the power of, and which were taught me not of man but of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    At the same time, I would love all that love <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    though they differ from me in some points. The angels love all the true worshippers of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span> every where,
    <a id="p435"></a>and why should not we? If our brethren will quarrel with us, let us not quarrel with them. O my dear brother, I pray our dear Redeemer to give you meekness to those, who may not see so far as you do. I entreat you, my dear brother, to overcome their evil with your good. Zeal for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may excite others to oppose you, as well as you to oppose them; therefore bear with and love them. This will shew you to be a disciple indeed, and to have that mind, which was in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    O that we grew up into his divine likeness, and were indeed conformed to our great Exemplar! How truly simple and void of guilt should we be! Our brother, I fear, has not dealt uprightly with me. At first he called me a servant of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and then a blasphemer and deceiver, and said, I should be in a miserable condition. Pray tell <i>P――</i> of it, and acquaint him at the same time, that I grow happier and happier in the Lamb every day, and more and more honoured by the great Head and King of the Church. O simplicity! whether art thou fled?—In a short time I hope to embark for <i>Georgia</i>, and then, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall see you face to face. Wonderful things have been doing here; things unspeakable and full of glory. The confusions abroad are no greater than what I expected to hear of. Just such a scene hath been at home; but the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> will over-rule all for good. Why have you not written to my poor family in <i>Georgia</i>? I am persuaded great things will come from the orphan-house. O remember, my dear brother, to exercise catholic love in all its branches. I love and long much to see you. I shall write, <span
      class="smcap">God</span> willing, to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>.
    I find his spirit is also imbittered. May the <span

    sweeten all your hearts! With hearty thanks for all favours, I am, my very dear brother,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR kind letter came to hand a few days ago, and I rejoice to hear that you are now happy. I wish you may be really settled and rooted and grounded in love, and
    <a id="p436"></a>no longer so tossed about as you have been in times past. I find many talk and boast of rest, of which I fear they have not yet got a feeling possession. There is as much difference between these two, as between a shadow and the substance. Far be it from me, to think thus of you, my dear brother. No, I believe our Saviour has really loved and washed you in his blood, and redeemed you unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that you might be a king and priest, and reign upon the earth. There is plenteous redemption in the blood of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    He came, not only that we might have life, but that we might have it more abundantly. He that believeth on <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. They that believe enter into rest. O glorious redemption! O glorious liberty of the children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed; they, who having not seen, yet have loved <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and do rejoice with joy unspeakable, even with joy that is full of glory. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that you feel more of this than you did a twelvemonth ago. In a year’s time, you will be ashamed to think what a dwarf you are now. A believer is to pass from glory to glory. It is ignorance and pride that makes us think we have already attained. The more we are acquainted with <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    the more we shall be acquainted with our own hearts, and grow more truly poor in spirit every day. Indeed, my dear brother, I am a thousand times happier than when you saw me. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath saved me from many corruptions, and is every day transforming me more and more into his own likeness. I cannot rest, unless I feel a sensible growth in my soul, and find that I get more of the true artless simplicity that was in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span> for that fulness which is in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    out of which we are all to receive grace for grace. Many, many souls have lately been drawing out of this fulness. I am amazed at his love to me! O free grace! O sovereign, distinguishing, unmerited love!—I think you did well in receiving some particular persons into your house. “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers,” says the Apostle. I cannot think it is right, to be so far carried away with an orthodox scheme, as to neglect acts of love to the members of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    body. Give me leave, my dear brother, to behave with all meekness toward those, who may not be so well affected toward such whom you love. If you do not take care, and
    <a id="p437"></a>keep close to the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    your spirit may be imbittered, and you may yet insensibly sink into bigotry. Some of our <i>English</i> friends, I am sure, have done so. It is a blessed thing to be kept free. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    can do this for you, my dear brother, and I am persuaded he will. In the love of a crucified <span

    <i>My dear Brother F――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your two kind letters, dated <i>June</i> the <abbr
      title="first">1st</abbr> and <abbr
      title="sixth">6th</abbr>, and can only say, <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is king in <i>Zion</i>, and orders all things well. I think you cannot have a scene of greater confusion among you, than there has been in <i>England</i>. But blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    matters are brought to a better issue, and though we cannot agree in principles, yet we agree in love, Tho’, as you know, I am clear in the truths of the gospel, yet I find that principles of themselves, without the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    will not unite any set of men whatever; and where the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is in any great degree, there will be union of heart, though there may be difference in sentiments. This I have learnt, my dear brother, by happy experience, and find great freedom and peace in my soul thereby. This makes me to love many, though I cannot agree with them in some of their principles. I dare not look upon them as wilful deceivers, but as persons who hazard their lives for the sake of the gospel.—<abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    I think is wrong in somethings, and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>
    wrong also; yet I believe that both <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i> and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>,
    and others, with whom we do not agree in all things, will shine bright in glory. It is best therefore for a gospel-minister, simply and powerfully to preach those truths he has been taught of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and to meddle as little as possible with those who are children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    though they should differ in many things. This would keep the heart sweet, and at the same time not betray the truths of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    I have tried both the disputing, and the quiet way, and find the latter far preferable to the former. I have not given way to the <i>Moravian</i> Brethren, or <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W—y</i>,
    or to any, whom I thought in an error, no not for an hour.
    <a id="p439"></a>But I think it best not to dispute, when there is no probability of convincing. I pray you, for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake, to take heed lest your spirit should be imbittered, when you are speaking or writing for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    This will give your adversaries advantage over you, and make people think your passion is the effect of your principles. Since I have been in <i>England</i> this time, <i>Calvin</i>’s example has been very much pressed upon me. You know how <i>Luther</i> abused him. As we are of <i>Calvinistical</i> principles, I trust we shall in this respect imitate <i>Calvin</i>’s practice, and shew all meekness to those who may oppose. My dear brother, you will not be offended at my using this freedom. I am a poor creature, unworthy to advise you; but I simply tell you a little of my own experience. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    give you, and all that stand up for the doctrines of the gospel, a right judgment in all things! For <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>’s
    sake, as much as in you lies, put a stop to disputing. It imbitters the spirit, ruffles the soul, and hinders it from hearing the small still voice of the Holy Ghost. May you be filled with all joy and peace in believing! <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been very gracious to me here. Wonderful things have been done in <i>Scotland</i>. When I shall come to you, I cannot as yet determine. I hope to embark in a few months. In the mean time, be pleased to remember me to all that love the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>, and accept this in tenderest love from, my very dear brother,</p>

    <i>My most endeared Friend and Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR short letter, dated <i>July</i> the <abbr
      title="fourteenth">14th</abbr>,
    I received two days ago, to my great satisfaction. I am glad my dear family is removed to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    and rejoice, that our glorious <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    had raised him and his brother up, to be such friends in time of need. Our all-wise Saviour saw this, and therefore sent them to be converted at the Orphan-house. O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    thou art fearful in praises, glorious in holiness, doing
    <a id="p440"></a>wonders! I trust this will find you, my dear friends, and my dear lambs, happily settled at <i>Bethesda</i>. I cannot think, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will give you over into the enemies hands, or that he will suffer the enemy to abide in <i>Georgia</i> for any considerable time. My thoughts have been variously exercised, but my heart kept stedfast and joyful in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords, whose mercy endureth for ever. The kings taking <i>Lot</i>, and <i>Abraham</i> recovering him out of their hands, hath been much pressed upon my heart. <i>Abraham</i>’s going into the land of <i>Canaan</i>, and being driven out by a grievous famine soon after he came there, has also been applied to my soul. And those words of <i>Moses</i>, “These enemies which you see, you shall see them no more,” have fallen with great warmth, and wait upon me. These things put together, keep my mind humbly depending upon <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    in a full assurance that some great and good event for the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will ere long be brought about. I am supported in a peculiar manner, and kept from staggering through unbelief.—With this, I send you a continuation of the Orphan-house account, which I printed to satisfy the public, and to promote future collections. The news about the <i>Spaniards</i>, perhaps may strike a damp upon the collection at this time; but even this shall work for good. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has a wheel within a wheel. O, my dear brother, how do I long to be with you! You need not say, “if possible now come over,” for I have long wished for the wings of a dove to fly to <i>Georgia</i>. I yet owe upwards of two hundred and fifty pounds in <i>England</i>, upon the Orphan-house account, and have nothing towards it. How is the world mistaken about my circumstances: worth nothing myself, embarrassed for others, and yet looked upon to flow in riches? Our extremity is <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    opportunity. O faith, thou hast an all-conquering power! Surely, my dear man, you and the rest of you will grow now in this time of trial. Fear not, neither be dismayed: the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> your <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will fight for you. I put my trust in him, and through his mercy I shall not miscarry. He still strengthens me to go on from conquering to conquer. I pray for you, I think and dream of you almost continually. I long, I long to be with you, and methinks could willingly be found at the head of you kneeling and praying, though a <i>Spaniard</i>’s sword should be put to my throat. But alas! I know not how I
    <a id="p441"></a>should behave, if put to the trial: only we have a promise, “that as our day is, so our strength shall be.” I would gladly write to you all, but being so variously employed, having the superintendency of so many souls and so many spiritual affairs, in many different places, I feel a little of what <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>
    says, when he wrote these words, “besides that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.” What am I? <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I adore and worship! I hope ere now you have had letters from brother <i>G――</i> and <i>Philadelphia</i> friends. Some there, are suspicious that I am joined with the <i>Moravian</i> Brethren, but indeed I am not. My principles are still the same; only as I believe many of them love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    I would love and be friendly to them, as I would be to all others, who I think bear the image of our common Master, notwithstanding some of my principles differ from theirs, and are as far distant as the East is from the West. Glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    for keeping me stedfast to those truths, which himself and not man hath taught me. I feel the power of them more and more every day, and am continually made happier and happier in the righteousness of the glorious Redeemer. O free, sovereign, distinguishing, electing, everlasting, infinitely condescending love! it quite amazes me. The thoughts of this love carry me above every thing. My dear friend, the <i>Spaniards</i> cannot rob us of this, nor can men, or devils. It is immutable and eternal as <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    himself. May the meditation on this, lead us nearer and nearer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    that we may every day, every hour, every moment be more and more conformed to his blessed image, and ripen more and more for eternal glory. But I must have done. Adieu! my dear man, adieu! I am ready to weep tears of love. Humbly hoping, that I shall shortly hear of the spiritual and temporal welfare of you all, I subscribe myself, with the utmost sincerity and affection,</p>

    <i>Reverend and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>O my great and abundant satisfaction, I received your long wished for letter of <i>June 3</i>. It was late at night ere it came to hand; but I could not go to rest without reading it. I read, and rejoiced, and prayed for the writer with my whole heart. O reverend and dear Sir, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows how closely I am knit to the dear ministers and people of <i>New-England</i>. They are ever upon my heart, and it rejoiced me to find I was not forgotten (unworthy as I am) by them. Dear Sir, I am glad to hear that the work still goes on; be not surprized, if you are forsaken. <i>Paul</i> was served so, and when I came to <i>England</i> most of my old friends and spiritual children were exceedingly prejudiced against me. Our great high-priest sees these trials to be necessary for us, to try our faith, and teach us to cease from man. I hope they have produced this blessed effect in some measure upon my soul. There seems to be such a scene in <i>Philadelphia</i>, as we have had in old <i>England</i>. I have wrote to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>.
    He in a late letter thinks me too charitable; but my conscience doth not reproach me for that. My principles are still the same. I embrace the calvinistical scheme, not because <i>Calvin</i>, but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    I think, has taught it to me. I go on preaching the cross and power of the Redeemer, and desire to say as little as possible about others, lest thereby I should divert people’s minds from the simplicity of the gospel. I have often found that opposing, instead of hurting, makes erroneous people become more considerable. This made me wish, that the <i>Boston</i> ministers would not take up so much time in speaking against the Exhorters. It will only set the people the more upon following after them; but I cannot well judge at such a distance, and indeed I find I am such a poor creature, that I scarce know any thing yet, as I ought to know. At the same time, I will not deny what I have received; no, this would be dishonouring my dear Saviour. He makes me daily more and more happy in himself, and I continually rejoice in his great
    <a id="p443"></a>salvation. At present he supports me in an uncommon manner, and the news of the <i>Spaniards</i> attacking <i>Georgia</i> affects me no otherwise, than to increase my faith and confidence in him, whom I am sure careth for me and mine. O dear Sir, what a glorious thing is divine faith! May you have much of it, and feel the power of it more and more every day! With repeated salutations and returns of love, I once more subscribe myself, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    that you are retired from the world, full of piety and devotion. I congratulate you, honoured Sir, upon your happy change, and pray that you may be filled with all the fulness of <span

    Exceedingly engaged as I am, I could not but send a line to you, because I love you in the bowels of <span

    I remember your command; I have you upon my heart, and pray the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> to do more abundantly for you and yours, than you are able to ask or think. It is impossible to tell you what the <span

      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Indeed, honoured Sir, I could wish for a thousand lives. My <span

    should have them all. Methinks I hear you say, “thus it is with me.” Hail then happy man! All generations shall call you blessed. Honoured Sir, my soul is full in the midst of many trials. O what a glorious redemption hath <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    purchased for us! Indeed it is a plenteous redemption. By the power of his death we are enabled to tread sin, death, and satan under our feet. This is the present frame of my soul. O free grace! unsearchable riches! The brightness of it dazzles the eyes of my faith. <span

    <i>My very dear Brother E――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE I wrote last, your other kind letter, dated <i>July 24</i>, came to hand, by which I find matters at <i>Philadelphia</i> are much the same as when you wrote before. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to give me wisdom, and a right understanding, to judge of those different jarring accounts that are sent me. As far as I am able to determine, I think some who have the truths of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    on their side, defend themselves with too great a mixture of their own spirit, and by this means perhaps some persons may be prejudiced even against truth itself. This is one rock, I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    my dear brother, to keep your soul from splitting against. Again, I think the <i>M――n</i> Brethren shew a better and milder spirit in the general; but many of their principles deviate as far from the truths of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    as the east is from the west, or the north from the south. I wish you may not have gone a step too far. It was unjust for <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>’s
    brother to be denied preaching in the new building. Shall I commend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    for this? I commend him not. The brethren should have some other place to preach in, and not make that house a Babel. I cannot give up truth for them, or for any other under heaven. I find they are as weak and fallible as those whom they judge not to have drank so deeply of the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>;
    and therefore, my dear man, though we love all, we must be upon our guard, and follow not man’s teaching, but the teaching of the Holy Ghost. Though principles are not to be rested in, yet it is a good thing to have a clear head as well as a clean heart. Some people make nothing of principles; but why are they so zealous in propagating their own? I think, my dear brother, I am a happy
    <a id="p445"></a>sinner, and have really entered into an abiding rest in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, through the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>;
    but yet the stirrings of corruption I expect in some degree or other, till I breathe my last. This I hope is all that dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>
    insists on. My dear brother, love the brotherhood, but do not give up the truths of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    and when you are brought off from idolizing one creature, take care you do not insensibly fall into idolizing another. Do not think that all things the most refined christian in the world does, is right; or that all principles are wrong, because some that hold them are too imbittered in their spirits. It is hard for good men, when the truths of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    are opposed, to keep their temper, especially at the first attack. Nothing but the all-conquering blood of the dear Redeemer can destroy the wild-fire in the heart. You will see what I have wrote to the dear Trustees. I hope our loving Saviour will incline you to comply with my advice. I believe it is from him, and will much tend to the prosperity of Zion. That, I trust, we have all at heart. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    we may be enabled so to act, as to do nothing to obstruct it, but bear and forbear with one another in love, and give way in some things to promote the common good. You see, my dear man, how freely I write to you. It is out of the fulness of my heart. I hope you and I shall be happily surprized, in finding each other better than we expected. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    forbid that we should live one hour without growing more like the blessed Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I am too credibly informed, that some make it their business to prejudice my friends against me. Such wisdom cometh not from above. They are as the false apostles, of whom Saint <i>Paul</i> spoke, “They would exclude us, that you might affect them.” But glory be to free grace! I can repose myself in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and am happy in him. However I may be dealt with by man, blessed be his name, I am now happy in the midst of various trials, even beyond expression. I only add, through grace I have laid the foundation; let others beware how they build thereon. Adieu, my dear brother. I am, with cordial respects and affection,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>ESTERDAY your kind and profitable letter came to hand. My dear wife being embarked, I opened, read, and now snatch a few moments to answer it. I took your hints upon <i>Jacob</i>’s ladder, and preached upon it with freedom yesterday in the afternoon. I trust some will be induced to begin to climb, and others be stirred to climb faster; at least I shall myself for one, for indeed I am ashamed I have mounted no higher yet. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am ascended so far as to have the world almost out of my sight, and I see my dear master standing at the top reaching out his hand, ready to receive me up into heaven. Indeed, my dear brother, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath dealt most bountifully with me; he gives me to rejoice in all his dispensations towards me. It well becometh <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    children to give thanks for all things that befal them, since it is <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    will concerning them. I am taught more and more every day to live by faith in the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who loved and gave himself for me. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    keeps me, and brings me where I would desire to be, at his feet, waiting his will, and watching the motions of his blessed spirit, word, and providence. Here I find safety and refuge amidst the various storms of opposition and reproach which I daily meet with. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is on my side, I will not fear what men nor devils can say of, or do unto me. The dear <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr> <i>E――s</i>
    have dressed me in very black colours.—<abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>’s
    pamphlet will shew you how black. Dear men, I pity them. Writing I fear will be in vain. Surely they must grieve the holy spirit much. O for a mind divested of all sects and names and parties! I think it is my one simple aim to promote the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    without partiality and without hypocrisy, indefinitely amongst all. I care not if the name of <i>George Whitefield</i> be banished out of the world, so that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    be exalted in it. Glory be to his great name, we have seen much of his power and greatness in <i>Scotland</i>. The work in the west still goes on and increases. Last sabbath-day, and <i>Monday</i>, very great things, greater than ever, were seen at <i>Kilsyth</i>. There is a
    <a id="p447"></a>great awakening also at <i>Muthel</i>, and many living stones building up in <i>Edinburgh</i>. I preach twice every day with great power, and walk in liberty and love. At the same time I see and feel my vileness, and take the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to be my righteousness and all. I purpose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to go through <i>Newcastle</i> and <i>Yorkshire</i> to <i>England</i>. <i>Ireland</i> I believe must be left till another circuit. In about three weeks, I purpose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to leave <i>Scotland</i>, and hope to spend a month ere long in <i>Wales</i>. My dear and honoured brother, I hope the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will give you an heart to pray for me, for indeed I am a very poor sinner, and many are waiting for my halting; but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is able and willing to make me stand. I have been much strengthened, since the <i>Spaniards</i> have invaded <i>Georgia</i>.

      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I hope you will not be offended with me, for troubling you with this. Your honoured lady tells me, you will not. Love, I am persuaded, inclines me to write, and I doubt not but you will receive it in the same spirit. Dear Sir, I rejoice to hear that you are a good soldier of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and that you delight to fight the Redeemer’s battles. May you be covered with all his armours and filled with all his fulness! I have the pleasure

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    makes me more than conqueror through his love. He has brought mighty things to pass here, and gotten himself the victory in many hearts. I trust, there is not a day passes but some poor creature or another is plucked as a brand out of the burning. I wish I could hear <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was more in the camp. Blessed be his name for raising you up, honoured Sir, to lift a standard for him. May you be endued with the meekness of <i>Moses</i>, the courage of <i>Joshua</i>, the zeal of <i>Paul</i>, and a large portion of the blessed spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>!
    I hope, honoured Sir, you will now and then remember me a poor sinner, and speak a word for me to the King of kings and <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of lords, that I may not turn my head in the day of battle, but rather die for, than deny him in any wise. Neither you nor yours are forgotten by me. Indeed I am a poor creature, but happy, very happy in the once crucified, but now exalted <span

Yesterday morning I had your kind letter dated <i>October 5</i>. In answer to the first part of it, I say, “Let old things pass away, and all things become new.” I can heartily say, “Amen” to the latter part of it. “Let the king live for ever, and controversy die.” It has died with me long ago. I shall be glad to see the extract of your journal. Be pleased to send it immediately, under cover, to <abbr

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    for putting it in your heart so to do. I have been upon my knees praying for you and yours. O that nothing but love, lowliness, and simplicity may be among us. It grieves me to see what a sad spirit prevails among <abbr

    wrought for me? Before the news came of the <i>Spaniards</i> leaving <i>Georgia</i>, the words came to my mind, that were pressed on me in the park with great power: “These enemies which you have now seen, you shall see no more.” What a life is a life of faith? I know I am reckoned enthusiastic, even by many christian friends, in respect to my Orphan-house; but “he that believeth, doth not make haste.” I find we must be tried by friends, as well as by foes. All is intended to bring us nearer to the friend of all. I hope I improved my interest in him just now, for you and yours, and for all <i>Edinburgh</i> friends. As soon as we had perused the letters, we kneeled down, and prayed, and gave thanks. Good news came from <i>London</i>, I hope, next post,

How do I long to hear how it is with your dear souls, and that you are returned to <i>Bethesda</i> in safety! The cloud seems now to be moving toward <i>America</i>. I trust I shall be with you in a few months. Wonderful great things did the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    perform for me and his people in <i>Scotland</i>. The concern expressed at my departure, was really unspeakable. O my dear, my very dear brother, the love of <span

    to such an unworthy wretch quite amazes me. I rode
    <a id="p452"></a>post, and came here in rather less than five days from <i>Edinburgh</i> on <i>Saturday</i> last, and here seems to be a new awakening. We have been obliged to enlarge the tabernacle. The <span

      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
    at another; at <i>Glasgow</i> about 128<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
    with private donations. I think we got about 300<abbr

    I owe nothing now in <i>England</i> on the Orphan-house account; what is due is abroad. I think since I have been in <i>England</i>, we have got near 1500<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will raise up what we want further; glory be to his name. He keeps my faith from failing, and upholds me with his right hand, and makes me happier in himself every day. My wife lies now very weak. She was tossed for ten days in her voyage from <i>Scotland</i>: The ship was in imminent danger, but the <span

    gave her much of his presence, and I trust she will be ready shortly for another voyage. She heartily and most lovingly greets you all, as does in haste,</p>

    has rebuked your fever, and that this will find you risen and ministring unto him. O, my Lord, I think I can
    <a id="p456"></a>say, “It is good for me that I have been afflicted;” for had it not been so, I should have gone astray. How apt are we when in health, to follow <span

    afar off, and sink into tepidity and a laodicean spirit? May this sickness be sanctified to the purging of your Lordship’s soul, and be a means of drawing you nearer to <span

    and his Church. My brother, you cannot think of it with too much solemnity. It is a matter of great importance, in which the future comfort of your life much depends. I would advise you to read over the matrimonial office, and turn it into a prayer. As for outward affairs, I think it quite proper to have them settled, as I am a minister of <span

    and ought therefore to be freed as much as may be from all worldly incumbrances. Be pleased to draw out your account, and when the captain comes, desire him to draw out his, that receipts may pass on both sides. I shall pay <abbr

    guide the meek in his way! I believe your turning back from <i>Ludlow</i> was of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Dear brother <i>H――</i> was about that time going into <i>Wales</i>, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    sending me hither (unworthy as I am) to transact affairs for you. I have seen your letter to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>,
    and likewise that from brother <i>C――</i>, to the bishop of <i>Bangor</i>. I am just now sending it to him, with a letter from myself, desiring leave to wait upon his Lordship. What the event will be, our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    only knows. This, however, we know, “All things shall work together for good to those that love <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;”
    and the gates of hell shall never prevail against the church of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    What you have met with, is no more than might be expected long ago. There has been a hook in the Leviathan’s jaws, or otherwise our mouths had been stopped long before this time. I had once the honour of being publickly arraigned, for not reading the Common Prayer in a Meeting-house. At another time, I was taken up by a
    <a id="p458"></a>warrant for correcting a letter wherein were these words, “Shall our Clergy break the Canons.” The prosecutions were unjust, but there is our glory. I remember when <i>Socrates</i> was about to suffer, his friends grieved, that he suffered unjustly. What, says he, would you have me suffer justly? If we are buffetted for our faults, and take it patiently, says a greater than <i>Socrates</i>, we are not to glory; “but if we are reproached for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and suffer as Christians, happy are we.” I think our present sufferings are for him. Surely the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    and of glory will rest upon you. However, I trust this storm will soon blow over. If possible, let an open separation from the church be avoided. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    can tell you more by word of mouth. I trust the glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has sent him amongst you, in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of peace. He is a dear soul. I am persuaded you are dear to him: I find you are dear to me, though I never saw you. It is enough, that we have drank into one spirit. This creates an indissoluble union. Pray remember my kind love to dear brother <i>C――</i>. I wish him joy with all my heart; but would not have him deny that exhorting is preaching. The Chancellor will be too many for him; for to be sure, exhorting is at least one part of preaching. Granting this, he has warrant enough, notwithstanding, from scripture, to tell others what <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has done for his soul, and to bid them come and see and believe in a precious <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    O that word! How sweet is it to my soul? It is like ointment poured forth. Had I time, I could tell you much of his love. He has been exceeding good to me in <i>Scotland</i>: He is still so to me here. Vile, base, ungrateful as I am, he lets me lean on his bosom night and day. My dear brother, help me to praise him, and engage all the brethren’s prayers in behalf of one, less than the least of all saints, but</p>

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    pray in my behalf; for I am still strengthened more than ever, and enabled to rejoice in his goodness all the day long. The confusion at <i>New-England</i> has given me concern; but our <span

    will over-rule all for good. I was sorry to hear of <abbr

    imprisonment; and to be imprisoned for an unguarded expression, I think is too, too severe, and not for the honour of <i>Boston</i> at all. Had I been in his place, I should have accepted bail. When I shall come to <i>Boston</i>, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    only knows. I believe it will not be long. I find I shall come in perilous times; but that all-gracious Saviour, who has helped me hitherto, will guide me by his council, and give me a true scriptural zeal. This is what I desire all my friends to beg in my behalf. How hard is it to keep in the true narrow path, when speaking for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>? <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    preserve me, and all his ministers, from defending his truths and cause in our own, or under the influence of a false spirit! It destroys the very cause we would defend. As yet, in <i>Scotland</i> there have been but few of the disorders complained of amongst you. But as the work increases, I suppose the enemies stratagems will increase also. This is my comfort, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    reigns. The gates of hell shall never be able to prevail against his church. I have had a late instance of his power and goodness, in driving the <i>Spaniards</i> out of <i>Georgia</i>. I hear they are gone. I hope the Orphans are now at <i>Bethesda</i> in peace. The continuation of my account, I have sent with this, and a parcel of my sermons. Be pleased to dispose of them, as you shall think proper. I salute all my Reverend brethren that preach <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    in sincerity. I wish them prosperity with all my heart, and pray for them every day, Reverend Sir, my
    <a id="p460"></a>soul is now filled with a sense of redeeming love. O why me, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    why me? Even so my Saviour, for so it seemed good in thy sight! But I can write no more, having much business on my hands. We go on well here. Our <span

    <i>My Lord</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS evening I received your Lordship’s kind letter. I humbly thank your Lordship for it. It confirmed me in the character given me of your Lordship’s spirit. I verily believe your Lordship abhors every thing that has a tendency to persecution, and yet, in my humble opinion, if <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    is not somewhat redressed, he is persecuted indeed. That your Lordship may know his spirit, and the spirit of the person who came as far as <i>Ludlow</i> on the business, I have sent
    <a id="p463"></a>your Lordship a letter from each, which was written some time ago to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H―― H――</i>.
    In them your Lordship will see their whole hearts. I verily believe they would rather die than wilfully speak or write a falshood. My Lord, the whole of the matter seems to be this: In <i>Wales</i> they have little fellowship meetings, where some well-meaning people meet together, simply to tell what <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has done for their souls. In some of these meetings, I believe <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    used to tell his experience, and to invite his companions to come and be happy in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    He is therefore indicted as holding a conventicle; and this I find is the case of one, if not two more. Now, my Lord, these persons thus indicted, as far as I can judge, are loyal subjects to his Majesty, and true friends to, and attendants upon the Church of <i>England</i> service. You will see by these letters, how unwilling they are to leave her; and yet, if all those acts, which were made against persons meeting together to plot against Church and State, were put in execution against them, what must they do? They must be obliged to declare themselves Dissenters. I assure your Lordship, it is a critical time in <i>Wales</i>. Hundreds, if not thousands, will go in a body from the Church, if such proceedings are countenanced. I lately wrote them a letter, dissuading them from separating from the Church, and I write thus freely to your Lordship, because of the excellent spirit of moderation discernible in your Lordship, and because I would not have (to use your Lordship’s own expression) “such a fire kindled in, or from your (Lordship’s) diocese.” I would beg the favour of your Lordship to return me the inclosed, because I have not kept copies. I send them to your Lordship just as they are, that your Lordship may see the whole affair, and censure what is exceptionable. I really believe the writers will thank your Lordship for it. I ask pardon for taking up so much of your Lordship’s time, but I thought your Lordship would desire to have all possible information, that you might be better capable of judging. I pray the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls to direct your Lordship in this, and every other affair that comes before you, and that you may be saluted at the great day with an <i

That he might not be imposed upon by the Chancellor’s representing of things, I last night sent his Lordship another long letter, with that which you wrote to dear brother <i>H――</i> some time ago. As the Bishop seems to be a man of a moderate spirit, I trust this storm will blow over. In the mean while, let us wait upon the <span

    commit the cause into his hands who judgeth righteously, and pray, that we may be “as wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.” Glad shall I be to serve you, my dear brother, in this, or any other affair, for advancing our glorious Mediator’s kingdom. Let this be our comfort, the gates of hell shall never be able to prevail against it. Let us go on then, and never fear what men or devils can say of, or do unto us.

    <span class="dropcap">G</span>OD willing, I intend waiting upon the honourable Trustees at the time appointed. Yesterday I received a packet of letters from my friends at the Orphan-house. I find they are returned in safety to <i>Bethesda</i>, and give a noble account of the General’s conduct. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    for enabling him to repel the enemy; but now another distress is come upon poor <i>Georgia</i>. A violent sickness rages and has taken off many. My letters say, the Orphan-house surgeon had 50 under his hands. This, I trust, will more and more convince the Honourable Trustees, of the benefit the Orphan-house is and will be to the Colony. I hear, that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>O――</i>,
    the minister of <i>Savannah</i>, is dead. I know one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>,
    a clergyman in the <i>Isle of Man</i>, who would go over and supply his place, if he was applied to. The Bishop of <i>Sodor and Man</i> I believe will give him a recommendation. You may acquaint the Honourable Trustees with this, and let me know their answer. I hope in about two months to embark for <i>Georgia</i>. I find <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has given my family a good crop; but the hands are sick, so they cannot speedily carry it in. What condition the Orphan-house was in lately, the inclosed will shew. Be pleased to let the Honourable Trustees have a sight of it, and believe me to be, dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE I wrote to your Lordship, I have received a comfortable packet of letters from <i>Georgia</i>, giving me an account of my family’s safe return to their <i>Bethesda</i>. The deliverance of <i>Georgia</i> from the <i>Spaniards</i>, one of my friends writes me, is such as cannot be parralleled, but by some few instances out of the Old Testament. I find that the <i>Spaniards</i> had cast lots, and determined to give no quarter. They intended to attack <i>Carolina</i>, but wanting water they put into <i>Georgia</i>, and so would take that Colony in their way. But “the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.” Providence ruleth all things. They were wonderfully repelled and sent away, before our ships were seen. Surely <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    remembered the prayers of the poor orphans, and the earnest cries which have been put up on their behalf. I find they now live at a smaller expence. They hunt and shoot for a good part of their food. Their crop gives them a considerable quantity of peas, potatoes, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    and they kill some of their own stock. There has been a great sickness at <i>Savannah</i>. Some of the labourers have been taken off, but none of the children, as I hear, have died as yet. I hope this will find your Lordship perfectly recovered, and your honoured consort, Lady ――, and all your Lordship’s family, rejoicing in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    He is pleased to give me much of his love, and to bless me every day. Several of our friends in <i>Wales</i> have been unjustly excommunicated.

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter affected me much, and if it had not been for business, I should have answered it ere now. It is the hardest thing in the world to keep the creature in his proper place. We are apt to esteem the ministers of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    either too much or too little. One while, we could pluck out our eyes to give them; at another time, run into a contrary extreme, and not pay them that respect which is their due for their Master’s sake. The love that a child of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    feels for its spiritual father, is certainly unspeakable. O how can I but love him, who under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has brought me from darkness into light! Methinks I hear dear Miss <i>W――</i> say, “how indeed!” But here is danger, lest the affections should be too much entangled, and we unwilling to give up the beloved object to our <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    This, I suppose, is dear Miss <i>W――</i>’s case, and I can say,</p>
  <div class="quotectn txt_sm">
    <div class="metered align_lt padl_20 hang_20 txt_i">

    O what have I suffered in parting from spiritual friends, especially such as were my <i>Isaac</i>’s! But <span

    grace has been sufficient for me, and so it will be for you. I have prayed for you, and hope by this time dear Miss <i>W――</i> can say, my spiritual Father keeps his proper place, and I walk in liberty and the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Indeed, my dear Miss, no one but the searcher of hearts knows, what a real concern I have for your eternal welfare. I verily believe I shall see you sitting at the right hand of your Redeemer. Surely he has captivated and stolen your heart away. I hope nothing will divert you from him; but with a single eye to his glory, you will go through good report and evil report, ’till you come to the blessed place, where the wicked will cease from troubling, and your weary soul enjoy an everlasting rest. Glad shall I be to hear from you every opportunity. Ere long I must away. Pray our Saviour to help me under all my difficulties,
    <a id="p469"></a>but at the same time help me to praise him: for amidst all my various circumstances, I am kept joying in <span

    and wish you much prosperity in the work of the <span

    Your honoured father’s memory is very precious to me. His account of the Orphan-house hath, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    been a great support and encouragement to me in a like undertaking. How it prospers, the account sent with this will inform you. Only it will be proper to observe, that since the publication of the last, there have been upwards of 300<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> collected.
    <a id="p470"></a>I am yet about 400<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
    in arrears. But I know in whom I have believed, for the carrying on of that building. Hitherto it has answered its motto, and has been like the burning bush on fire, but not consumed. The Colony’s late deliverance from the <i>Spaniards</i> was very extraordinary. I cannot but think the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    intends yet to do great things for <i>Georgia</i>. How is it with the <i>Saltzburghers</i>? I have not heard. Sometime ago I sent them over twenty pounds, and wish it was in my power to send them more. About <i>January</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I intend to embark. In the mean while, I should be glad to know, <abbr
      title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Sir,
    how it is with your Orphan-house? and whether you have any commands to <i>Georgia</i>? I suppose you have heard of the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in <i>Scotland</i>. Indeed the word has run and been glorified, and <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has gotten himself the victory in many hearts. In <i>England</i> also he is pleased to bless us. Here are many close followers of the blessed Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and though there is a difference of opinion between me and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>, yet <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    pities us and blesses us all. I long for that time, “when the watchmen shall all see eye to eye; when the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the lion eat straw like the ox, and the people of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    learn war and jangle no more.” Hasten that time, O glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>, and let thy kingdom come!—<abbr
      title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Sir,
    whilst I am writing, the fire of love kindles in my heart. I am amazed, to think the blessed <span

    should employ such an unworthy wretch as I am: But thy grace is free, for, O my <span

    it found me out. The love you bear to the lovely <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Beg your Lordship’s pardon for troubling you with this. I believe your Lordship will not be offended, when you know the cause. There is one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>, a true lover of <span

    <a id="p472"></a>Christ</span>, who has been much honoured in bringing many poor sinners in <i>Wiltshire</i> to the knowledge of themselves and of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    He is a member of the Church of <i>England</i>, but sadly opposed by the clergy in <i>Wiltshire</i>, as well as by many that will come to hear him preach. In a letter, dated <i>November <abbr
      title="sixteenth">16th</abbr></i>,
    from <i>Toxham</i>, he writes thus: “The enemy seems to be more awakened in the villages round about us, than before. The ministers of <i>Bramble</i>, <i>Segery</i>, <i>Langley</i>, and many others, have strictly forbidden the church-wardens and overseers to let any of the <i>C――</i>’s have any thing out of the parish; and they obey them, and tell the poor, if they cannot stop them from following any other way, they will famish them. Several of the poor, who have great families (to my own knowledge) have already been denied any help, for this reason, because they follow this way. Some of the people have, out of fear, denied they ever came, and others have been made to promise they will come no more; whilst the most part come at the loss of friends and all they have. When the officers threatned some to take away their pay; they answered, if you starve us, we will go, and rather than we will forbear, we will live upon grass like the kine.

    of <i>Sabaoth</i>.” In another letter I received from him last night, he writes thus: “I should be glad if you could mention the cruelty of the ministers of <i>Bramble</i>, and <i>Segery</i>, to the Bishop of <i>Sarum</i>; indeed, their doings are inhuman. The cry of the people, because of their oppression, is very great; several suffer amazingly.”—In compliance with my dear friend’s request, I presume to lay the matter, as he represents it, before your Lordship, being persuaded that your Lordship will not favour persecuting practices, or approve of such proceedings to keep people to the Church of <i>England</i>. Should this young man leave the Church, hundreds would leave it with him. But I know that at present he has no such design. If your Lordship pleases to give me leave, I would wait upon your Lordship upon the least notice. Or if your Lordship is pleased to send a line into <i>Wiltshire</i>, to know the truth of the matter, and judge accordingly, it will satisfy, my Lord,</p>

It has so affected me, that I have been praying before my Saviour for you; and though nature calls for rest, I cannot obey it, before I have written to my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>.
    Vile, unfaithful as I am, my Master lets me have my hands full of work. From morning ’till midnight I am employed, and, glory be to rich grace, I am carried through the duties of each day with chearfulness, and almost uninterrupted tranquility. Our society is large, but in good order, and we make improvements daily. My Master gives us much of his gracious presence, both in our public and private administrations. In our love-feasts, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    comes and says, “Peace be unto you.” In our great congregation, he gives poor sinners to look, and mourn, and live. In <i>Scotland</i> the work was very extraordinary. In <i>Wales</i> the word runs and is glorified much. In <i>Gloucestershire</i>, <i>Wiltshire</i>, and <i>Bristol</i>, our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gets himself the victory in many hearts. In <i>Newcastle</i>, our brother <i>W――</i>’s are blessed much, and I heartily rejoice to hear that our dear Saviour is so much among you. If I know any thing of this my desperately wicked heart, I am dead to parties, and freed from the pain, which on that account once disturbed the peace of my soul. Indeed, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has taken many things from me, and made me to experience, that in him there is plenteous redemption. About <i>January</i>, I purpose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to embark for <i>Georgia</i>. My dear family hath been wonderfully preserved. As the Orphan-house was built by faith, I trust the gates of hell shall never prevail against it. Methinks I hear my dear <abbr

    say, Amen. I most cordially salute your dear Lady, dear brother <i>S――</i>, and all the brethren. I saw our dear <i>S――</i> before he went.

If dear brother <i>H――</i>, or <i>D――</i>, or any of the brethren, have any thing to say to a poor sinner, I should be glad to hear
    <a id="p474"></a>from them. Let this provoke you, my dear brother, to send me another letter. I’ll redeem time from sleep, rather than it should not be answered by, my dear <abbr

    for your plain dealing. It is what pleaseth me well. Indeed, I feel myself a poor, vile, worthless creature, and am glad to receive advice from you, who have been so long in the Redeemer’s service. However ungrateful it may be to the old man, the language of my heart is, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    search me and try me, and whatever secret wickedness lurks in my soul, discover it to me, and give me power over it, that nothing may divert me from that way, which leads me to life everlasting.” Your advice, <abbr

    <a id="p475"></a>Sir, in respect to preaching, was salutary and good, and if I may speak any thing of myself, is what I keep close to. I am remarked for my evangelical preaching, and comforting the mourners of <i>Zion</i>. I am never so much in my element, as when I preach free grace to the chief of sinners. As to the gentleman you mention, I do not remember I ever conversed with such a person. I believe there can scarce an instance be given of any one sent to <i>Bedlam</i> by my sermons. But I rejoice in this, and all other calumnies that are cast upon me.</p>

    I must have some thorn in the flesh, to serve as a poise to the great honour my Master is pleased to put upon me. In <i>Scotland</i>, my reception was extraordinary. It was almost wholly amongst the people and clergy of the <i>kirk</i>, with many of the highest rank. I was very intimate with several persons of quality, who I trust have been awakened to a true sense of the divine life, and enabled to count all things but dung and dross for the excellency of the knowledge of <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> their <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    My chief opposition was from the dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>E――s</i>
    and the associate presbytery. They first invited me to <i>Scotland</i>; but finding I would preach for the ministers of the established church, as well as for them, they spoke all manner of evil against me falsly, and imputed all the work in <i>Scotland</i> and <i>New-England</i> to the agency of the evil spirit. I pitied, prayed for, and loved them, and do so still. O, reverend Sir, what thanks shall I give to my <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    for carrying me through so many trying dispensations? I know you will help me to adore and praise him. I am much blessed here. We have many gracious souls. Ere long I must leave them. I have not the least thought of seeing <i>Worcester</i>. Glad shall I be to kiss your aged hands; but I shall see you in glory.

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">L</span>AST night, just before your kind letter came to hand, I had been lying on my face before our compassionate High-Priest, telling him what great expences lay before me for his great Name sake. I wanted 300<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
    to pay for the Orphans, and much to pay for my own necessary expences, which he, by his providence, brought upon me. Your letter came as an answer to my prayer. It humbled, at the same time that it elated my soul, and greatly strengthened my faith. Surely the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is on my side, and the Orphan-house will stand unconsumed in fire. The enemies, and even many friends of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    speak against it; but this is all to bring me nearer to the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and to convince me that our extremity is <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s opportunity. My dear man, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will abundantly bless you for helping me at this juncture. I can find but few, who think it a favour to do any thing for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and love to help a friend to the very last. O, dear Sir, was you here, I could weep over you, and thank you most heartily. Last night I was enabled to intercede for you very much. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will hear my prayer, and not let my dear friend lose his reward. The <abbr

    of this month was my birth-day. It made me blush to think how much sin I have committed against, and how little good I have done for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    As soon as I opened and read your letter, amazed, I cried out, I am the vilest wretch living, and so I think now. I know you will pray for me, and thank our Saviour too. He is very kind to me. Our society goes on well. I am now in my winter-quarters, preparing for a fresh campaign. Though I richly deserve it, yet our infinitely condescending <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will not lay me aside, until he has performed all his good pleasure in and by me. Wishing you, my dear Sir, all the blessings of the everlasting covenant, and sending you ten thousand thanks for all favours, I subscribe myself,</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN your letters come, I find great freedom to send immediate answers. A proof this, I trust, that our Saviour intends our brotherly love not only to continue, but increase. This day I dined with old <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>F――</i>,
    and was kindly entertained by him and his wife. I then remembered what sweet counsel we had there taken together, and rejoiced in the happy prospect of our being ere long for ever together with our blessed and glorious <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    My brother, what has our Saviour done for us since that time? What is he doing for us now? what did he do ere time began? what will he do when time shall be no more? O how sweet is it to be melted down with a sense of redeeming love! It is this must strike the rock, and break the bars of unbelief asunder. O! to be kept always low at the feet of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>!
    It is right, my brother, always to insist on poverty of spirit, and emptying the creature of self. I heartily join with you in your petition for yourself and unworthy me. I know what a dreadful thing it is, to carry much sail without proper ballast, and to rejoice in a false liberty. Joy floating upon the surface of an unmortified heart, is but of short continuance. It puffs up, but doth not edify. I thank our Saviour that he is shewing us here more of our hearts, and more of his love. I doubt not but he deals so with you. I heartily greet your dear houshold, and your societies, and return my love to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>.
    I have heard him mentioned by lady <i>F―― G――</i>. If our Saviour gives me leave, I would gladly come to <i>Yorkshire</i>. But I think the cloud points strongly towards <i>Georgia</i>. He hath taken wonderful care of the sheep left in yonder wilderness, and interposed mightily in their behalf. I know you will thank him for it. I have had a loving conference with dear <abbr

    and have received a sweet gospel-letter from dear <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR kind letter put me in mind of righteous <i>Lot</i>, whose soul was grieved day by day at the ungodly conversation of the wicked. It was the same with holy <i>David</i>. His eyes, like yours, honoured Sir, gushed out with water because men kept not <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    law. Let this be your comfort, honoured Sir, that ere long “the wicked shall cease from troubling you, and your weary soul shall be at rest.” Our Saviour will give you a discharge, when you have fought a few more battles for him. An exceeding and eternal weight of glory is laid up for you, which <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    the righteous judge shall give you at that day. I confess your situation and employment cannot be very agreeable to a disciple of the prince of peace. But persons can better judge for themselves, than strangers can judge for them. However, I cannot say, I would change posts. Indeed, honoured Sir, I think mine is a glorious employ. I am not ashamed of my master, though my master may well be ashamed of me. I know no other reason, why <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has put me into the ministry, than because I am the chief of sinners, and therefore fittest to preach free grace to a world lying in the wicked one. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    he gives much success, and for the generality answers your prayers, by giving me a thriving soul in a healthful body. But O my unfruitfulness! I am often ashamed that I can do no more for that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    who hath redeemed me by his own most precious blood. Honoured Sir, the thoughts quite confound me. O that I could lie lower! then should I rise higher. Could I take deeper root downwards, then should I bear more fruit upwards. I want to be poor in spirit. I want to be meek and lowly in heart. I want to have the whole mind that was in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    Blessed be his name for what he has given me already. Blessed be his name, that out of his fulness I receive grace for grace. O that my heart was <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    library! I would not have one thief to lodge in my Redeemer’s temple. “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    scourge out every thief,” is the daily language of my heart. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto him. I have
    <a id="p479"></a>just been writing to your honoured lady. I think she grows in grace. May you and yours be filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>! In about six weeks, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose to embark for <i>Georgia</i>. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has wonderfully appeared for my poor orphans. I am yet in arrears for them, but my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows how to supply all my wants. I am enabled to cast all my care upon him, believing that he careth for me. I hope to have the favour of another letter before I embark. In the mean while, I beg the continuance of your prayers, and am, honoured Sir,</p>

I find by yours to my wife, that you complain of darkness. Ere now, I hope the day-star hath again risen in your heart, and you have been made to rejoice with exceeding great joy. Our <span

    will not be always chiding.—This is only to shew you more of your heart, and make you what you long to be, a very poor sinner. Our hearts, Honoured Madam, are so desperately wicked, deceitful above all things, that without repeated instances of feeling our helplessness and misery, we should forget ourselves, and run away from the feet of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    and Saviour. He therefore, in love, empties before he fills; humbles before he exalts. At least, he is pleased to deal thus with me. I thank him for it, from my inmost soul: for was it not so, his mercies would destroy us. He helps me also to praise him. When I discover a new corruption, I am as thankful as a centinel keeping watch in a garrison, would be at spying a straggling enemy come near him. I stand
    <a id="p480"></a>not fighting with it myself in my own strength, but run immediately and tell the captain of my salvation. By the sword of his spirit, he soon destroys it, and makes me exceeding happy. This is what I call a simple looking to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I know of no other effectual way of keeping the old man down, after he has gotten his deadly blow. Look up then, dear Madam, to a wounded Saviour. Go to him as a little child. Tell him your whole heart. He will hear your lisping, and set your soul at liberty. He is pleased graciously to answer my petitions, and to bless my poor labours. We have many good souls in our society, that are gently coming into the knowledge of themselves. Our Saviour deals most lovingly with us indeed. Last night we had a general love-feast. It was exceeding awful and refreshing. I could have wished for some of my dear <i>Scotland</i> friends. I was enabled to pray for them most fervently. May <span

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
